# Running Aureon

Last updated: 2026-05-13

This is the canonical runbook for the current Aureon runtime. The recommended full-organism terminal entrypoint is the production wake-up launcher, not individual exchange bots.

For a plain-English map of every major subsystem and what it can do, read [SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md](SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md).

The launcher starts the production supervisor, market runtime, status/telemetry server, mind hub, self-questioning loop, organism observer, manifest refresh, and unified frontend console.

## Current Entrypoints

| Purpose | Command |
|---|---|
| Full Windows production supervisor | `.\AUREON_PRODUCTION_LIVE.cmd -WaitForRefresh -MarketStatusPort 8791` |
| Validate launcher and flags without opening services | `.\AUREON_PRODUCTION_LIVE.cmd -ValidateOnly -NoOpen -MarketStatusPort 8791` |
| Low-priority data ocean supervisor | `.\AUREON_DATA_OCEAN.cmd -Adaptive -CoverageProfile LicensedReachable` |
| Dev/audit ignition path | `python scripts/aureon_ignition.py --audit-only` |
| Standalone runtime status server | `python aureon/exchanges/unified_market_status_server.py --port 8791` |
| Frontend development server | `cd frontend; npm run dev` |

Use port `8791` for the current runtime feed when older local sessions may still own `8790`.

## Run The Whole Organism

Open PowerShell:

```powershell
cd C:\path\to\aureon-trading
.\AUREON_PRODUCTION_LIVE.cmd -WaitForRefresh -MarketStatusPort 8791
```

Leave this terminal open. It is the production supervisor. A healthy launch prints:

```text
Mode: LIVE_TRADING_OPERATOR_CONFIRMED + COGNITIVE_ORDER_INTENT_AUTHORITY + PRODUCTION_SUPERVISOR
LLM/cognitive order-intent authority: ON
Production supervisor attached
```

## Safe Validation

Run this before a live session, after pulling updates, or after editing launch docs:

```powershell
.\AUREON_PRODUCTION_LIVE.cmd -ValidateOnly -NoOpen -MarketStatusPort 8791
```

Validation checks the launcher profile and command wiring without starting the full console stack.

## Watch The Runtime

Open the unified console:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8081/
```

Watch local endpoints from a second PowerShell window:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:8791/api/terminal-state | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 8
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:8791/api/flight-test | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 8
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:8791/api/reboot-advice | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 8
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:13002/api/thoughts | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 8
```

The console also reads the wake-up manifest from:

```text
state/aureon_wake_up_manifest.json
frontend/public/aureon_wake_up_manifest.json
```

## Run The Data Ocean

Use a second PowerShell terminal for wide market mapping and historical/context refresh:

```powershell
.\AUREON_DATA_OCEAN.cmd -Adaptive -CoverageProfile LicensedReachable
```

This supervisor runs below normal priority and keeps heavy ingestion/backfill separate from live trading. Its reports are:

```text
state/aureon_data_ocean_status.json
frontend/public/aureon_data_ocean_status.json
docs/audits/aureon_global_financial_coverage_map.json
frontend/public/aureon_global_financial_coverage_map.json
docs/audits/aureon_exchange_data_capability_matrix.json
frontend/public/aureon_exchange_data_capability_matrix.json
```

Private account-history sync is budgeted so it does not overload Kraken or other account APIs while the live runtime is active. The default Kraken private trade-history cap is `50` records per cycle. To run only public/context/history ingestion for a cycle, use:

```powershell
.\AUREON_DATA_OCEAN.cmd -Adaptive -CoverageProfile LicensedReachable -SkipAccountSync
```

The data ocean report includes the official exchange rate-limit registry from `aureon/core/exchange_rate_limit_registry.py`. Live exchange rows expose `official_rate_limit` and `cash_aware_call_plan`: venues with active cash or positions reserve calls for execution, balances, positions, and recovery; idle/no-cash venues can use more of their safe provider budget for streams, quote probes, and candidate discovery.

The exchange data capability matrix turns that into an operator checklist for each venue: data channels, trading modes, fresh feed state, decision-fed state, official call budget, cash-aware optimization mode, gaps, and next optimization. It is published to `docs/audits/aureon_exchange_data_capability_matrix.json` and mirrored to `frontend/public/aureon_exchange_data_capability_matrix.json` for the Trading console.

Capital.com live expansion is controlled by the Capital Survival Brain in the Trading console. The runtime publishes `capital_risk_envelope`, `capital_trade_evidence`, `capital_confidence_ratchet`, `capital_unified_waveform_check`, `capital_no_loss_hold_queue`, and `capital_pending_order_envelope`; live Capital entries are dynamically sized or held when portfolio reserve, margin utilization, stress buffer, concentration, confidence, or cross-exchange waveform evidence is not strong enough.

Build or widen the Capital tradable asset book when you want every discovered Capital market mapped to epic, cost, margin, leverage, minimum deal size, and execution route:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m aureon.exchanges.capital_asset_registry --max-snapshots 250
```

The registry writes `state/capital_tradable_asset_registry.sqlite`, `state/aureon_capital_tradable_asset_registry.json`, and audit/public JSON/CSV/Markdown outputs. Pending Capital bids are planned as working orders with broker take-profit evidence, but submission remains opt-in through `CAPITAL_PENDING_ORDER_SUBMIT_ENABLED=1`; the survival envelope blocks ladders that would be unsafe if all pending orders filled at once.

For a no-ingest validation pass:

```powershell
.\AUREON_DATA_OCEAN.cmd -ValidateOnly -DryRun -RunOnce -NoIngest
```

## Runtime Modes

| Mode | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `safe_observation` | Runtime or feed is offline, or live environment is not enabled. |
| `guarded_observe_plan` | Live runtime is enabled, but action blockers such as stale ticks, open-position restart windows, or booting state remain active. |
| `guarded_live_action` | Runtime is fresh, live environment is enabled, real order capability is enabled, and guards are clear. |

The guard layer is not a separate trading strategy. It is the runtime evidence layer that prevents stale data, duplicate supervisors, unsafe reboot timing, credential mistakes, API-rate overload, payment/filing automation, and unowned security mutation from being treated as live action.

## Runtime Resilience

The status feed should be read as connected-but-guarded when `ok:false` appears with a fresh status file and heartbeat. `/api/terminal-state` exposes stale reason, open positions, API governor state, exchange readiness, executor route state, and tick phase. Direct execution routes use a timeout so a slow exchange call is held and reported instead of freezing the whole tick loop.

Use `/api/flight-test` and `/api/reboot-advice` before any restart. If open positions exist, the launcher should preserve monitoring and wait until the flight-test reports `can_reboot_now: true`.

## Live Trading Preconditions

Before live operation, confirm:

- Exchange credentials are present in `.env` for Kraken, Binance, Alpaca, and Capital as applicable.
- Withdrawal permissions are disabled on exchange keys.
- The launcher validation command passes.
- `http://127.0.0.1:8791/api/terminal-state` reports `trading_ready: true` and `data_ready: true`.
- `stale` is `false`, or the console clearly shows a guarded state while waiting.
- Capital.com entries show a positive stress buffer and clear waveform/ratchet state in the Capital Survival Brain before dynamic live slots expand.
- `http://127.0.0.1:8791/api/flight-test` allows reboot only when the runtime is in a safe downtime window.

## Dev And Audit Paths

Use ignition for local audit and dry-run checks:

```powershell
python scripts/aureon_ignition.py --audit-only
python scripts/aureon_ignition.py --no-trade
python scripts/aureon_ignition.py --accounts-status
```

The production launcher remains the recommended full Windows organism entrypoint.

## Legacy Or Dev-Only Commands

Do not use old root scripts as the main run path. These are obsolete, deprecated, or dev-only references:

- `python aureon_live.py`
- `python aureon_unified_ecosystem.py`
- `python3 scripts/paperTradeSimulation.ts`
- `.\scripts\runners\run_unified_live.cmd`

Use the production launcher for full operation and `scripts/aureon_ignition.py --audit-only` for dev/audit checks.

## Verification

```powershell
.\AUREON_PRODUCTION_LIVE.cmd -ValidateOnly -NoOpen -MarketStatusPort 8791
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_ignition_live_profile.py tests/test_unified_market_status_server.py tests/test_aureon_organism_runtime_observer.py -q
```

Verify the active OS/LLM/task/code/skill surfaces:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_safe_code_control.py tests/test_inhouse_llm_adapter_audit_mode.py tests/test_goal_capability_map.py tests/test_capability_growth_loop.py tests/vault/test_skill_executor_bridge.py -q
```

Frontend build check:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run build
```

## Stop And Recovery

Press `Ctrl+C` in the production supervisor terminal to stop supervising. Background services keep their own process state.

To relaunch cleanly, close older elevated terminals that may still own ports `8081`, `8790`, or `8791`, then run the production launcher once. Do not force-kill the market runtime while positions are open; use the flight-test and reboot-advice endpoints to wait for a safe downtime window.
