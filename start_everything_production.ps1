.SYNOPSIS
    One-command full Aureon + Flameborn production launch.
.DESCRIPTION
    Starts the entire Aureon organism in production mode AND the Flameborn
    frontend with runtime, host terminal, and sandbox enabled.

    WARNING: This opens live trading gates. Only run when you intend to
    trade with real money on configured exchanges.

    Safety blocks that REMAIN active (not overridden):
    - External attack capabilities: BLOCKED
    - Companies House / HMRC automatic filing: BLOCKED
    - Tax / penalty automatic payments: BLOCKED

    These blocks protect you from legal/financial autopilot errors.
    They are hardcoded organism safety limits, not runtime bugs.
