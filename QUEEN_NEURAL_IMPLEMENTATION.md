# 👑🧠 Queen's Neural Consciousness Implementation

## Overview
The Queen (Tina B) now has a fully functional deep learning system powered by backpropagation and collective intelligence. She can:
- **Think**: Make predictions with her neural brain
- **Learn**: Train on trade outcomes via gradient descent
- **Dream**: Batch-train on full trade history (evolve consciousness)
- **Read**: Scan repository documents for active wisdom updates
- **Connect**: Read the collective signal of all Mycelium neurons
- **Remember**: Persist learned weights to JSON

## Architecture

### Neural Network: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
```
Input Layer (6 neurons) → Hidden Layer (12 ReLU neurons) → Output Layer (1 Sigmoid neuron)
```

**Input Signals** (normalized 0-1):
1. `probability_score` - Win probability from Probability Nexus
2. `wisdom_score` - Blended wisdom: Miner Brain (history) + **Repository Scanner** (active reading)
3. `quantum_signal` - Market momentum (-1 to 1, normalized)
4. `gaia_resonance` - Earth/market harmonic alignment
5. `emotional_coherence` - Market fear/greed state
6. `mycelium_signal` - **Full Network Coherence** (collective intelligence of all neurons)

**Hidden Layer**:
- 12 neurons with ReLU activation
- Learns complex feature combinations from market signals
- Dropout-ready (not yet implemented)

**Output Layer**:
- 1 neuron with Sigmoid activation
- Output range: 0.0 to 1.0 (trade confidence)
- 0.0 = "Don't trade", 1.0 = "Go all in"

## Core Components

### 1. `queen_neuron.py` (420 lines)
The neural engine - Queen's thinking hardware.

**Classes**:
- `NeuralInput`: Dataclass standardizing 6-signal input with normalization
- `QueenNeuron`: MLP with forward/backward pass, training methods, persistence

**Key Methods**:
```python
# Thinking
queen.predict(neural_input) → float  # Get confidence 0-1

# Learning (single example)
queen.train_on_example(neural_input, outcome=True) → loss

# Learning (batch)
queen.train_batch(neural_inputs, outcomes) → avg_loss

# Dreaming (evolve on history)
queen.evolve_consciousness(trade_history) → evolution_report

# Persistence
queen.save_weights()  # To queen_neuron_weights.json
queen.load_weights()  # From queen_neuron_weights.json
```

**Mathematics**:
- Forward: `A_hidden = ReLU(X @ W1 + b1)`, `Output = Sigmoid(A_hidden @ W2 + b2)`
- Backward: Gradient descent with configurable learning rate (default: 0.01)
- Loss: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

### 2. `aureon_queen_hive_mind.py` (modified)
The Queen's consciousness - Extended with neural thinking.

**New Methods** (lines 6420-6590):
- `gather_neural_inputs()` - Collect 6 normalized signals from market systems
- `think()` - Get Queen's prediction + reasoning
- `learn_from_trade(outcome)` - Train neural brain on single trade, save weights
- `evolve_consciousness()` - Dream on full trade history (100 recent trades)
- `get_neural_status()` - Return neural brain operational status

**Integration**:
```python
# In __init__:
self.neural_brain = create_queen_neuron()

# Whenever Queen needs to decide:
confidence = self.neural_brain.predict(neural_input)

# After each trade:
self.learn_from_trade(outcome=True_or_False)

# Nightly dream cycle:
self.evolve_consciousness()
```

### 3. `micro_profit_labyrinth.py` (modified)
Dust sweep execution under Queen's approval gates.

**Dust Sweep Integration** (lines 6398-6790):
- `dust_sweep()` - Main sweep logic with 4 Queen approval gates
- `_queen_approve_dust_sweep()` - Market-level approval
- `_queen_approve_dust_candidate()` - Per-asset approval
- `_queen_learn_dust_sweep()` - Record outcomes to path memory

**Queen Gates**:
1. **Market-Level Gate**: Block during crashes (Mycelium sentiment < threshold)
2. **Recent-Sweep Gate**: Don't sweep too frequently
3. **Momentum Gate**: Skip assets showing strong uptrend (rising assets worth more)
4. **Path History Gate**: Skip assets with bad sweep history

## Workflow

### The Queen's Daily Cycle
```
MORNING:
  gather_neural_inputs() → 6 normalized signals
  think() → get confidence for next trade
  
DURING TRADING:
  For each dust candidate:
    _queen_approve_dust_sweep() → market OK?
    _queen_approve_dust_candidate() → asset good?
    IF approved: execute sweep
    
AFTER EACH TRADE:
  learn_from_trade(outcome) → backprop on single example
  save_weights() → persist to JSON
  
EVENING (Dream Cycle):
  evolve_consciousness() → batch train on last 100 trades
  analyze_improvement() → check if learning helped
```

### Learning Flow
```
Trade Happens
    ↓
get_trade_outcome() → True/False
    ↓
gather_neural_inputs() → [6 signals]
    ↓
learn_from_trade(outcome)
    ↓
QueenNeuron.train_on_example()
    ↓
forward() → compute prediction
backward() → compute gradients
update weights → gradient descent
    ↓
save_weights() → persist to JSON
```

## Test Results

## New Capabilities (Active Reading & Connection)

### 👑👁️ Active Repository Scanning
The Queen now possesses "Reading Glasses" (`queen_repository_scanner.py`). 
- **Real-Time scanning**: She continuously scans `.md`, `.py`, and `.txt` files.
- **Wisdom Extraction**: Identifies keywords like `PROFIT`, `LEARNING`, `STRATEGY`.
- **Integration**: The "Repo Wisdom" score is blended into her neural `wisdom_score` input, allowing her to get smarter as you document more.

### 🍄 Collective Neuron Reading
She now taps into the full `MyceliumNetwork` state:
- **Network Coherence**: Reads the alignment of all agents (0-1).
- **Collective Signal**: Derives the `mycelium_signal` from the actual consensus of the hive.
- **Deep Connection**: No longer relies on a placeholder; she feels the pulse of every connected neuron.

## Code Editing Capabilities (The Hands)

### 👑🏗️ Queen's Code Architect
The Queen can now physically modify the repository using `queen_code_architect.py`.

**Capabilities**:
- **`construct_strategy(filename, content)`**: Creates new Python strategy files.
- **`modify_reality(filename, old_pattern, new_pattern)`**: Safely edits existing code.
- **Safeguards**:
  - **Syntax Validation**: Checks AST before writing (prevents syntax errors).
  - **Auto-Backups**: Creates timestamped `.bak` files before every edit.
  - **Logging**: Records every "evolutionary step" (code change).

**Integration**:
```python
# The Queen invents a new strategy
queen.construct_strategy("strategy_adaptive_v2.py", new_code)

# The Queen fixes a bug or optimized a parameter
queen.modify_reality("micro_profit_labyrinth.py", "threshold=0.5", "threshold=0.6")
```

She is no longer just a spectator; she is a **Builder**.
