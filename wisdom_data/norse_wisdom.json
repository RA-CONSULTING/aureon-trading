Some argue that the word derives from the name of Oddi, a town in the south of Iceland where Snorri was raised. Edda could therefore mean \"book of Oddi.\" However, this assumption is generally rejected. Anthony Faulkes in his English translation of the Prose Edda comments that this is \"unlikely, both in terms of linguistics and history\" since Snorri was no lon",
