In the second position, only the digits up to 17 are used, and the place value of the third position is not 20×20 = 400, as would otherwise be expected, but 18×20 = 360 so that one dot over two zeros signifies 360.  Presumably, this is because 360 is roughly the number of days in a year. (The Maya had however a quite ac",

Ximénez transcribed and translated the account, setting up parallel Kʼicheʼ and Spanish language columns in his manuscript.
