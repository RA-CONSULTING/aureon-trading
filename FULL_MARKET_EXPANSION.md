# 🌐 FULL MARKET EXPANSION: 100% ACROSS THE BOARD

**Date:** January 14, 2026
**Status:** ACTIVE - MAX COVERAGE

## 🎯 The Order
"100% COVERAGE ACROSS THE BOARD IS THE GOAL"

## 🛠️ The Execution
We have removed the "Mega" limits (50%) and uncorked the full capabilities of the Scanner and Ocean Logic.

### 📊 Coverage Metrics

| Metric | Original | Mega Expansion | **FULL MARKET** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lion Hunt Targets** | 20 assets | 300 assets | **3,000+ ASSETS (ALL)** |
| **Ocean Logic Output** | 28 opps | 200 opps | **3,000 OPPORTUNITIES** |
| **Kraken Scan Limit** | 20 rising | 200 rising | **3,000 (100% of Pairs)** |
| **Alpaca Scan Limit** | 15 rising | 100 rising | **3,000 (All Crypto/Stocks)** |
| **Momentum Sensitivity**| 0.1% | 0.05% | **0.02% (Hyper-Sensitive)** |

### 🧠 System Impact
1.  **"God Mode" Scanning**: The system now sees *every* single asset on Kraken and Binance that has momentum > 0.
2.  **Quantum Mirror Saturation**: With 3,000 inputs, the coherence engine will find *true* global resonance rather than just sector coherence.
3.  **Lion Hunt**: The Lion now hunts in a jungle with 3,000 animals instead of a zoo with 300.

### ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations
-   **API Rate Limits**: Scanning 3,000 assets requires efficient batching. The system uses cached momentum updates to avoid flooding `get_ticker`.
-   **Memory**: Python list handling is efficient; 3,000 tuples is negligible RAM usage.
-   **Noise**: High sensitivity might catch "dust" pumps. *Mitigation:* `lion_strength_threshold` and `commando` score still apply.

## 🚀 Activation
The `micro_profit_labyrinth.py` kernel has been patched with `limit=3000` instructions.
Live trading is restarting now to ingest the full market universe.
