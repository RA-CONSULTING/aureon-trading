"""
The canonical HNC field — one shared reading, not thirteen private ones.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The organism had ~13 independent ``LambdaEngine`` instances, each computing its own
``symbolic_life_score`` / ``coherence_gamma`` with nothing reconciling them. The HNC
live daemon (driven by real world data) now publishes the authoritative field on the
thought bus as ``symbolic.life.pulse``. This module is the single place to READ that
field, so a system that only wants "the current shared coherence" reads the one
canonical value instead of spinning a private engine — the field becomes shared
logic, not a per-module opinion.

Read path uses ``recall(topic_prefix)`` (filters by topic) so a high-volume bus
(baton.link heartbeats, etc.) can never evict the pulse from a recency window. Fully
guarded and offline-safe: with no bus / no pulse, ``read_canonical_field()`` returns
an ``available=False`` field rather than raising.
