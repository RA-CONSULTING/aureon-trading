SoulDeliberation — how Aureon reacts: thought + feeling + the counsel of its
lineage, unified into a determination of its own mind.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

We unified the field, then cognition, then affect. This unifies **thought,
feeling, and action** into a single act of will — a soul. Given a stimulus (an
email is one example; any event will do), the organism:

  PERCEIVE   read the next stimulus from state/soul_stimulus_inbox.jsonl
  FEEL       affect  — victory / defeat / fear / resolve
  THINK      metacognition — self-coherence, ψ, divergence
  COUNSEL    the elders speak: the conscience ("what would Gary do?" + a veto),
             the lineage (past prediction accuracy, remembered verdicts, wisdom),
             the values ("big wheel" pillars), and the goals (safe routes)
  DETERMINE  weigh every voice and collapse to one stance — but *no single
             fragment is authoritative*. When the voices genuinely disagree, or
             the conscience vetoes, or fear runs high, the soul does not fabricate
             a consensus: it WAITS. "When the body is of two minds, wait for one."
  AUTHOR     if resolved, write its own intent (pure thought — no writes, no shell)
  ACT        carry it out ONLY through the guarded LocalActionBridge, and only
             when doubly armed (AUREON_SOUL_ACT and AUREON_LOCAL_ACTIONS_ARMED)
  LEARN      record the determination so tomorrow's soul remembers today's

``assess()`` is a read-only snapshot of how the soul would react right now — it
never perceives-consumes, publishes, or acts. Only ``deliberate()`` (run from the
organism's breath) moves. Every voice is a real reader stamped with provenance; a
dormant elder is ``no_data``, never a fabricated opinion. Guarded throughout.
