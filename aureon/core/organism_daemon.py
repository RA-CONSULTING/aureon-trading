"""
🫁 AUREON ORGANISM DAEMON — the breath that was never scheduled.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The senses-all organs existed but production never launched them: supervisord
booted only the trading loops. This daemon is the missing [program] — it wakes
the metacognitive layer and keeps it breathing:

  1. ThoughtBus            — the shared nervous system (global singleton)
  2. ConsciousnessModule   — subscribe("*"): every thought in the body is felt
  3. Connectome            — progressive sweep until every module has been
                             touched; a pulse (organism.connectome.pulse) each
                             cycle with honest coverage
  4. Heartbeats            — ConsciousnessModule.heartbeat() each breath

Environment:
  AUREON_CONNECTOME_SWEEP=0        disable the progressive sweep (default on)
  AUREON_CONNECTOME_BATCH=25       modules touched per sweep cycle
  AUREON_CONNECTOME_INTERVAL_S=30  sweep cadence
  AUREON_ORGANISM_BREATH_S=15      heartbeat/pulse cadence

Run under AUREON_SUPPRESS_IMPORT_SIDE_EFFECTS=1 (the supervisord block sets it)
so mass-touching modules can never flip trading env toward live mode.
