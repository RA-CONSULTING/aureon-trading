"""
Cross-process bus trace — one signal, one dedicated file, re-read live.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The organism runs as several separate OS processes (``aureon_operator``,
``aureon_organism``, ``hnc_live_daemon`` under supervisord), each with its own
in-memory :class:`ThoughtBus`. A thought published in one process is invisible to
the others: ``recall`` reads only that process's memory, and ``subscribe``
handlers only fire for in-process publishes.

The proven, flood-proof way to cross that boundary is a **dedicated per-signal
trace file**: the producing process appends the signal to ``state/<name>.jsonl``,
and the consuming process re-reads that file live. Because the file carries ONLY
that one signal, a high-volume topic elsewhere (e.g. baton heartbeats) can never
bury it — the property the HNC field bridge (``hnc_field._read_field_from_trace``)
relies on. This module generalizes that pattern so every cross-process signal
uses one guarded, tail-bounded, multi-writer-safe helper instead of a bespoke copy.

Everything here is guarded and never raises: a missing or corrupt trace degrades
to "no data" (``[]`` / ``None``), never a crash and never a fabricated value.
