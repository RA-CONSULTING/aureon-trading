"""HarmonicObserver production-mode gate.

Three modes controlled by ``AUREON_OBSERVER_MODE``:

  ``dry_run`` (default — chosen for safety on first deploy):
      Observer + bus consensus + wave predictor all RUN. Their outputs
      are computed and logged to ``state/observer_audit.jsonl`` so a
      reviewer can see what the system WOULD have done. Decisions
      flow through original (pre-observer) logic — no Vote 7 veto, no
      narrow-band threshold tightening, no Kelly buffer scaling.

  ``shadow``:
      Same as ``dry_run`` for decision *outcomes* (no veto, no scaling),
      but the audit log explicitly tags the run as "shadow" so post-hoc
      analysis can compare shadow recommendations against actual trade
      outcomes. Operator runs this for N days/weeks before flipping
      to ``live``.

  ``live``:
      Full Stages L/T/V/Y behaviour — observer vetoes, narrow-band
      threshold raises, Kelly buffer widens. This is the originally-
      designed integration.

Switching modes is a single env-var change followed by a daemon
restart; no code change needed. The audit log writes in every mode so
the operator can compare modes apples-to-apples.

Why default to dry_run instead of live: Stages A–AA were all smoke-
tested but none of them have ever influenced a real exchange order.
Until they have, "live" should require operator opt-in.
