Aureon ↔ Obsidian Integration
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Thin client for the community `obsidian-local-rest-api` plugin plus a
filesystem fallback so the vault can mirror its thoughts into a real
Obsidian vault (notes, daily journal, tagged folders) even when the
plugin is not installed.

Two collaborators:

  ObsidianBridge  — talks to the Local REST API on https://localhost:27124
                    (HTTPS, self-signed cert, Bearer auth) and falls back
                    to a local filesystem vault if the API is unreachable.

  ObsidianSink    — subscribes to vault utterances / ticks / audit events
                    and writes them as markdown notes: daily journal,
                    per-voice folders, and a rolling "cognitive loop log".
