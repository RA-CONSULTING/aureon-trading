"""Build Aureon's company-of-agents capability bill list.

This module turns market-standard agent capabilities into an Aureon-native
company registry: departments, roles, handoffs, evidence, tools, authority
boundaries, and work orders. It is a registry and UI evidence layer first; it
does not grant new live-trading, filing, payment, credential, or destructive
OS authority.
