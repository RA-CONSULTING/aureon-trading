"""
Automation progress index — one honest number for "how far to fully automated".
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Phase 39 categorized *what* the organism can do; Phase 40 reported *how it is*. This
reports **how far along the automation is** — a single percentage measuring how much of
the repo is actually connected into the organism and driveable by the soul/consciousness
logic, decomposed so the number is never a black box.

It composes **only signals that already exist** — nothing is measured anew, nothing is
fabricated. Four dimensions, each a fraction in [0,1] (a dormant one is dropped, never
counted as zero):

  • connectivity  — baton-linked / total modules      (on the nervous system)
  • integration   — woven / total modules             (joined to mesh+Queen, driveable)
  • consciousness — organs live / 8                    (the directing mind is present)
  • surfacing     — domains reachable / total          (inspectable / operable)

The index is the weight-renormalized mean of the dimensions actually present; when every
dimension is dormant it is ``None`` (honest ``no_data``, never a fabricated 0). The
weighting is transparent — the full per-dimension breakdown is always returned — and
tunable. This is **observational only**: it measures, it changes nothing.
