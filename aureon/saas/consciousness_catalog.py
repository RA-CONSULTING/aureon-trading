"""
Consciousness catalog — the organism's inner capabilities, categorized.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The SaaS catalog (``catalog.py``) categorizes the ~715 filesystem modules; the
capability registry (``docs/capability_registry.json``) lists the outward products.
Neither knows the organism's **consciousness organs** — the self-perception, selfhood,
purpose, governance, workforce and body layers built breath by breath (self-awareness
→ feeling → soul → inner work → pursuit → the director's desk → the workforce → the
connectome). Each already emits an honest, ``truth_status``-stamped self-report and has
its own ``/api/*`` route, but nothing presented them *together, by category*.

This is that surface. It is **registry-as-data**: the static metadata (what each organ
does, its route, its safety posture, its category) lives here; the live ``{available,
truth_status}`` is pulled by calling each organ's existing read accessor behind a guard.
Nothing new is invented, nothing heavy is cold-booted in a request, and a dormant organ
reports ``no_data`` — never a fabricated capability.

The three safety postures are the honest categories of *what an organ may do*:
  • ``read_only_assess`` — it only perceives; a GET never makes it act or publish.
  • ``records_only_gated`` — it records a human decision; it never executes the move.
  • ``reversible_ascent_gated`` — it may compose only reversible/safe verbs, widening
    with the inner-work ascent; every irreversible move routes to the director's desk.
