"""
Aureon SaaS — the cognitive substrate as verified read APIs.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The organism is connected end-to-end — the HNC field, the connectome body-map,
the mycelium mesh, the thought bus, and the miner brain all breathe together.
This module *productizes* that substrate: it turns each cognitive and
meta-cognitive system into a first-class SaaS surface that anyone can read over
HTTP (``GET /api/cognition/...``), and it stamps every response with honest
**data provenance** so a consumer knows whether they are reading live truth,
a cached real value, or nothing at all.

Two invariants make this safe to expose:

  1. **Never cold-boot a heavy organ from a GET.** ``get_miner_brain()``,
     ``get_mycelium()`` and ``Connectome.sense()`` all have heavy / side-effectful
     init. So the brain surface reads the persisted prediction/knowledge files
     directly (never constructs the brain), and the mycelium surface reports only
     when the singleton already exists (``no_data`` / dormant otherwise) — the
     same posture ``build_organism_payload`` takes for the Queen.

  2. **Never fabricate.** Each surface carries a ``truth_status`` drawn from the
     repo's real-data contract vocabulary (``live`` / ``real_derived`` /
     ``cached_real`` / ``no_data``). When a signal is not flowing the surface
     says ``no_data`` with a blocker — it does not invent a plausible number.

Every builder is guarded and never raises: a dead organ degrades to an
unavailable surface, not a 500.
