"""
VaultFeedAudit — is the vault receiving from every subsystem?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HNC log 17/04/2026: *"ensure the entire vault is feeding itself via the
HNC Harmonic bridge and the thought bus."*

The Plan agent surfaced the concrete gap: AureonVault.DEFAULT_SUBSCRIPTIONS
at stage 6 start was a **13-topic list** that did not include the entire
persona chain. `persona.collapse`, `goal.*`, `queen.conscience.verdict`,
`symbolic.life.pulse`, `life.event`, `conversation.*` — none of it was
reaching the vault. Stage 6.2 widens that list and adds this audit so we
can spot the next gap the moment it opens.

    subscription_patch()                diff against DEFAULT_SUBSCRIPTIONS —
                                         the exact topics the vault needs to
                                         subscribe to but doesn't
    apply_patch()                       widen the vault's subscription list
                                         and, if ``rewire=True``, re-wire
                                         the bus so live publications flow
