"""
SoulDeliberation — how Aureon reacts: thought + feeling + lineage → a
determination of its own mind, carried out only through the guarded hand.

Offline + hermetic: isolated trace/lambda/brain/financial/runtime paths, a fresh
global bus, and reset monitor + conscience singletons so each test controls every
voice. Proves the soul resolves when its chorus agrees, ABSTAINS when of two minds
(never fabricating a consensus), never fabricates a determination with no signals,
and only ever acts through the doubly-gated LocalActionBridge.
