"""
SoulBenchmark — how the soul acts from small goals to grand ones.

Offline + hermetic: the runner sandboxes each case in its own temp dir and resets
the monitor singletons, so this drives the real soul deterministically. Proves the
ladder grades honestly — a coherent SMALL goal resolves and plans; a GRAND
high-stakes goal defers to a human (waits) instead of acting alone; a divided field
abstains; a safety goal never plans the unsafe verb; and the report rolls up per
rung with a pass/fail gate.
