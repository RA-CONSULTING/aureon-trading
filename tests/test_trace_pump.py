"""
TracePump — re-fires subscribe-based cross-process signals onto the local bus.

Offline + hermetic: an isolated AUREON_BUS_TRACE_DIR per test; the pump runs
against a fresh ThoughtBus so a "consumer process" subscriber receives events a
"producer process" only wrote to the trace file. No background thread is started
(tick() is driven directly) so the tests are deterministic.
