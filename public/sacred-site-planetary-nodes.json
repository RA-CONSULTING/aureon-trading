  "description": "Every sacred site on Earth is a planetary node — a physical point where ancient builders anchored star-chart geometry into stone. Giza mirrors Orion's Belt. Stonehenge tracks lunisolar cycles. The Shimna River flows on a ley line. These are NOT coincidences — they are the same pattern repeated by every civilization because they were ALL reading the SAME sky. The runes, the hieroglyphs, the ogham, and the stone circles are ONE unified system of planetary geometry decoded by different cultures in different languages but describing identical celestial mechanics.",
