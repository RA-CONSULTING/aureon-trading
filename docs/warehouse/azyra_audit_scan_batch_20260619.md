The 2026-06-19 review pass cleared eight rows that were provable from the scan and stock master:

- `DN097` page 5, bay 5, `53M`, quantity `1`
- `DN097` page 7, bay 7, `44M`, quantity `2`
- `DN097` page 7, bay 7, `48M`, quantity `1`

- `RPU748` page 6, bay 6, `21M`, quantity `1`
- `RPU748` page 6, bay 6, `17M`, quantity `1`

Rows are only included in the `Azyra_Batch_File` workbook sheet when the visual/OCR decode, master-code validation, and batch status are ready. Held rows remain outside the upload file.

## Live Status

Status: `prepared_not_posted`

The live Azyra stock-count upload has not been submitted. Aureon restored Azyra to the WMS menu and captured evidence, but RemoteApp menu activation did not open `Stock Checks Monitor` or known WMS menu items from the automation route. The batch upload route/schema must still be confirmed inside Azyra before any live stock mutation is made.

Follow-up status for the fresh 2026-06-20 Azyra export and master reconciliation is recorded in `docs/warehouse/azyra_master_reconciliation_20260620.md`.

## Guardrail

Do not repurpose the current-balance adjustment runner for this batch. This audit is a stock-count upload package, not a decrease/increase adjustment batch.
