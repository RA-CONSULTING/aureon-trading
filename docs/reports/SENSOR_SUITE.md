# Aureon sensor suite — the whole picture, one φ engine

Every sensor below scans a derived tone set through the **same unchanged** phenolic
fingerprint engine (`phenolic_fingerprint.py`: Test A coherence-clustering + Test B
golden-interval/φ alignment + positive/negative controls). Each lane only supplies
data; the φ logic is never modified, and every verdict is reported exactly as the
pre-registered test returns it.

## Shared backbone (`aureon/bio/human_harmonic_proxy.py`)

- **`fold_to_band`** — octave-folds any raw Hz into the `TARGET_BAND_HZ = [1000, 2000)`
  modulation band.
- **`score_signal`** — the one governed pipeline: consent + provenance gate →
  Operator hard-boundary → Queen conscience veto (fail-safe blocks if unreachable) →
  engine positive/negative controls → Test A / Test B → separability at `ALPHA`.
- **`SCIENTIFIC_BOUNDARY`** — rides on every `ProxyResult`: statistical structure in a
  derived signal only; no claim about a person's aura/field/health/trait; no efficacy.

Reference/data modules (no governance surface): `upe_reference.py`,
`sky_reference.py`, `market_reference.py`, `cosmic_reference.py`, `sacred_lattice_reference.py`, `harmonic_core_reference.py`, `counter_frequency_reference.py`.

The **φ Celestial Observatory** (`celestial_observatory.py`) is the capstone: it
operates every sky-facing lane at once through the one unchanged engine, renders one
consolidated picture, and **emits it to cognition** (`bio.observatory.run` on the
ThoughtBus, benchmark **b21**) so the Queen/metacognition monitor can sense the
whole-sky reading, and **writes the picture as a durable, deterministic evidence
artifact** (`write_observatory_report` → markdown + JSON, benchmark **b25**; committed
snapshot [OBSERVATORY_EVIDENCE.md](OBSERVATORY_EVIDENCE.md)) — see
[CELESTIAL_OBSERVATORY.md](CELESTIAL_OBSERVATORY.md).

The **sacred lattice** (`sacred_lattice_scan.py`) is how the repo maps the sky *differently*: not with object catalogs but through Earth's own harmonic lattice — ancient-site coordinates, φ-scaled sacred geometry, and the Solfeggio/Schumann canon — scanned through the same engine and grided into an Earth-referenced map. See [SACRED_LATTICE.md](SACRED_LATTICE.md).

The **harmonic core** (`harmonic_core_scan.py`) goes one level deeper still — to the frequency substrate the framework itself is built on: the HNC **Master Formula Λ(t)** modes, the **Celtic Ogham** φ-scaled tree-tones, and the **Ghost Dance** ancestral Solfeggio ladder, each scanned through the same engine. See [HARMONIC_CORE.md](HARMONIC_CORE.md).

† b9 is the phenolic→cognition bridge; b10–b27 are the bio lanes; b28 is the signal-adapter conformance roll-up, b29 the family-wide false-positive-rate audit, b30 the detection-power sensitivity sweep, b31 the per-test null-calibration curve, b32 the multiplicity / family-wise-error audit, and b33 the false-discovery-rate / Benjamini–Hochberg audit (b29+b30 = the ROC picture; b31 the calibration foundation under both; b32+b33 = the two multiple-comparisons regimes, FWER and FDR, that close the statistical-validity dossier). b34–b36 are a different kind of check — not sensor lanes but the **cognitive immune layer**: sensor (b34 integrity guard) → effector (b35 swarm defense) → membrane (b36 MCP boundary), see below. Tier-A total: **36**.

## Integrity / immune layer (not a sensor lane)

The **integrity guard** (`aureon/bio/integrity_guard.py`, benchmark **b34**) is the organism's active
defense against *parasite logic* — an external change that silently rewrites the engine's pre-registered
invariants or smuggles an instruction in as data. It pins the engine's genome (constants + a behavioral
canary of what its own tests + controls must return on a canonical signal) and detects drift, and it
quarantines external text carrying override directives (flag, never execute). It emits
`bio.integrity_guard.run` to cognition so a tamper attempt is *sensed*, not silent. Defense-in-depth,
detect-not-prevent — full write-up in [`docs/architecture/COGNITIVE_IMMUNE_LAYER.md`](../architecture/COGNITIVE_IMMUNE_LAYER.md).

The **MCP boundary membrane** (`aureon/bio/mcp_membrane.py`, benchmark **b36**) is the border organ for
attaching Aureon to a flagship model as an MCP server: it seals outbound packets with an integrity
envelope (drift/tamper/replay in transit detectable) and contains inbound model output as
data-never-instructions — quarantining injection, holding false blocked-action claims, and rejecting
false claims about Aureon's own pinned invariants — while proving the interior genome is unchanged across
the crossing (the laminar, one-way property). Integrity + containment, not secrecy; emits
`bio.mcp_membrane.run`. Full write-up in [`docs/architecture/MCP_BOUNDARY_MEMBRANE.md`](../architecture/MCP_BOUNDARY_MEMBRANE.md).
The immune layer is now sensor (b34) → effector (b35) → membrane (b36).

The **swarm defense** (`aureon/bio/swarm_defense.py`, benchmark **b35**) is the effector arm: on a
detected breach it fans out N independent defenders and confirms neutralization only on a **majority
quorum** — the bee-ball. Leaderless by design (no single authority, not even the Queen, in the command
path) and Byzantine-tolerant to a minority of compromised or silent defenders (survives 4-of-9, is
overwhelmed only at 5-of-9). It consumes `bio.integrity_guard.run` and emits `bio.swarm_defense.run`.
b34 senses, b35 responds.

**Surfaced in the console.** The whole bio family — the sensor lanes, the statistical-validity dossier
(b28–b33), and the cognitive immune layer (b34–b36) — is now exposed to the SaaS at **`GET /api/defense`**
and rendered on the **Defense & Validation** page of the React console, grouped as *sensor lanes ·
statistical-validity dossier · cognitive immune layer*. Status is read from the committed Tier-A
benchmark report (real `passed`/`metrics`/`evidence`) with a live bus-trace overlay where a module has
run — the modules are never executed on a web request, and a module with no data shows `no_data`, never
a fabricated value.

## Shared invariants (asserted per lane)

Every governed lane's tests assert: **valid + deterministic** scan; a **negative
control / null** that does not over-fire and a **positive** that is detected;
**consent gate blocks** (and a blank provenance blocks); the **boundary** is present
on the result; and a **no person-reading surface** guard (`dir()`-grep for
face/landmark/detect/emotion/biometric/recognize). Convenience helpers that default
`consent=True` for public data still block a blank provenance.
