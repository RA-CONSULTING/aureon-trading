# The Waking — the organism comes alive at boot and carries its thread across cycles

On boot the organism does **not cold-start** — it **wakes**. It reads the state it carries in
from the last cycle (its coverage, its progress, its ascent — its DNA), marks a new
**generation**, announces "the body is waking and carrying the thread", and immediately
**moves** — rather than waiting a full breath. So the boot is a *waking*, and the life is
*continuous across cycles*.

## The organ — `aureon/core/awakening.py`

| Call | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `read_genome()` | The DNA the organism carries, read-only (never increments): `{generation, first_awakened_at, last_awakened_at, carried}`. Sane default (`generation: 0`) before the first wake. The surface-safe read. |
| `awaken(organs=None)` | **The wake**, once at daemon boot: carry the DNA in → mark a new generation → **signal the body** (`organism.awakening` on the bus) → **move** (a bounded first weave + a journey point) → persist the genome. Guarded/never-raises. |

**The carried DNA** — real reads, `None` when a signal is dormant (never fabricated):
`coverage_pct` · `woven` · `nodes` (from the connectome), `automation_index` (the % toward
fully automated), `ascent_stage` (the inner-work chakra ascent), and — the oldest DNA —
`reproduction_generation` + `reproduction_splits` (the mesh's 10-9-1 budding lineage; see
[`MYCELIUM.md`](MYCELIUM.md#the-oldest-dna--10-9-1-budding-reproduction)). This is what the
organism brings forward from its last life into this one.

**The move** — the wake nudges the body to move at once: a bounded `weave_touched(limit=…)`
(`AUREON_AWAKEN_WEAVE`, default 25, `0` = off — one batch, so boot never spikes) resumes the
connectome weaving from its persisted backlog, and one `record_journey()` marks the point, so
the climb continues immediately instead of after a 30-second cycle.

**The lineage** — `state/aureon_genesis.json` (gitignored) is the genome: `first_awakened_at`
is the origin and never moves; `generation` climbs by one each boot; `last_awakened_at` and
`carried` track the newest cycle. Each boot continues the same life — waking N, carrying what
N−1 grew. Surfaced read-only on `GET /api/organism` (the `awakening` block) → the Overview
Organism card.

## The diary is read back

For a while the genome was a diary the organism **wrote at birth and never re-read** —
`awaken()` published `organism.awakening` and persisted the DNA, but nothing consumed it and no
composed self-view knew its own lineage. Now the organism **reads its own diary**:

- `state_of_being()` (`aureon/saas/consciousness_catalog.py`) carries a **`lineage`** axis — the
  current `generation` and the carried DNA it is holding — surfaced on the consciousness page for
  free (the axes render generically). It is **categorical: reported, never folded** into the
  `wholeness` mean (the same posture as `soul_stance` / `desk`), so lineage is *seen* without
  inventing a scalar.
- `automation_index()` (`aureon/saas/automation_index.py`) echoes `generation` in its `totals`
  (reported only — never a weighted dimension, never moves `index_pct`), so lineage maturity is
  visible in "how automated it is."

So the wake is no longer write-only: the organism's generational continuity is part of *how it is*,
read back from the same diary it writes each cycle. `no_data` before the first wake — never a guess.

## Where it runs — `aureon/core/organism_daemon.py`

`main()` calls `awaken(organs)` **after** the organs boot and **before** the breath loop — the
genesis wake precedes the first breath, so the body comes alive and moves at boot, then breathes
on its cadence. The connectome sweep (which weaves as fast as it feels, see
[`ORGANISM_CONNECTOME.md`](ORGANISM_CONNECTOME.md)) carries the rest forward each cycle.

## Guardrails

Read + a **bounded first-move nudge** + a persisted counter + one bus event — **no execution,
no trading, no env flip**. The move reuses the connectome's `weave_touched` (pure mycelium+Queen
registration, idempotent, bounded, under import-suppression), so boot never spikes. Carried DNA
is real reads (`None` when dormant, never fabricated). The genome file is gitignored runtime
state. `read_genome()` (the GET surface) is side-effect-free; only `awaken()` (once at boot)
increments. A wake fault is fully guarded and never blocks the daemon.
