# ⚡ AUREON POWER STATION - Energy-Focused Architecture

## Overview

The **Aureon Power Station** is the PRIMARY user interface for the Aureon Trading System. Unlike traditional trading dashboards that focus on financial metrics, the Power Station presents **everything as energy** - energy reserves, energy generation, energy consumption, and energy flows across the system.

## 🌌 Core Philosophy: Energy-Centric View

Traditional trading systems show:
- **Balances** in USD
- **Profit/Loss** in dollars
- **Trades** as buy/sell orders
- **Fees** as costs

The Power Station transforms this to:
- **Energy Reserves** (idle capital = potential energy)
- **Energy Generation** (profitable trades = energy created)
- **Energy Consumption** (losses/fees = energy drains)
- **Energy Redistribution** (trades = energy flow between states)

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Port Configuration
- **Port 8080**: Queen Power Station (PRIMARY - Public Interface)
- **Port 8800**: Command Center (SECONDARY - Internal Operations)

### Process Hierarchy (supervisord priorities)
```

## 🔄 Energy Flow Architecture

### How Energy Moves Through the System

```
[Market Data] → [Scanner Eyes] → [Brain Analysis] → [Queen Decision]
                                                            ↓
[Relay Energy Idle] ← [Energy Redistribution] ← [Orca Execution]
         ↓
[Deployed Position] → [Energy Generation/Consumption] → [Back to Idle]
```

### Energy States

1. **Idle Energy (Reserves)**
   - Capital sitting in exchange accounts
   - Available for immediate redistribution
   - Shows as "IDLE" in relay status
   - High mobility = good (ready to move)

2. **Deployed Energy (Positions)**
   - Capital in active trades
   - Locked until position closes
   - Shows as "DEPLOYED" in relay status
   - Lower mobility = energy in use

3. **Energy Generation (Profit)**
   - Successful trade closes above entry
   - Net gain after all fees/spreads
   - Added to "Energy Generated" metric
   - Returns to idle state with more energy

4. **Energy Consumption (Loss)**
   - Trade closes below entry
   - Net loss including fees/spreads
   - Tracked but NOT shown (focus on positive)
   - Returns to idle state with less energy

## 🐝 Queen's Energy Optimization

The **Queen Hive Mind** is the autonomous intelligence that optimizes energy flow:

### Decision Process

1. **Opportunity Scan** (every 60s)
   - Scans all 4 relays for idle energy
   - Identifies potential redistribution moves
   - Calculates expected energy gain/drain for each

2. **Queen Analysis**
   - Evaluates each opportunity with:
     - `calculate_energy_drain()` - Estimated energy consumed by fees/spreads
     - `will_trade_be_profitable()` - Net energy gain prediction
   - Only considers moves with **net positive energy** (gain - drain > $0.50)

3. **Execution Gate**
   - Approved moves sent to Orca Kill Cycle
   - Orca executes energy redistribution
   - State files updated with outcome
   - Dashboard shows decision in "Recent Energy Decisions"

4. **Learning & Adaptation**
   - Tracks all decisions and outcomes
   - Updates efficiency metrics
   - Improves future energy predictions

### Queen's Intelligence

The Queen doesn't just trade - she **optimizes energy flow**:
- **Blocks drains**: Rejects unprofitable opportunities (conserves energy)
- **Generates energy**: Executes only high-confidence positive moves
- **Tracks efficiency**: Learns from all decisions to improve
- **Autonomous**: No human intervention required

---

## 📊 Real-Time Updates

The Power Station updates every **5 seconds** with:
- Latest system energy totals
- Queen's most recent decisions
- Energy distribution changes
- Relay mobility shifts
- Energy generation metrics

All data is pulled from state files:
- `power_station_state.json` - Station metrics

## 🚀 Deployment

### Digital Ocean Configuration

**Region**: London (lon)  
**Instance**: professional-xs (1GB RAM, 0.5 vCPU)  
**Auto-deploy**: Enabled from `main` branch

**Ports:**
- **8080**: Queen Power Station (PRIMARY)
- **8800**: Command Center (SECONDARY)

### Process Startup Order

supervisord starts processes in priority order:

1. **Queen Power Station** (pri 1) - Interface starts first, shows "STOPPED" state
2. **Kraken Cache** (pri 5) - Begins feeding market data
3. **Orca Kill Cycle** (pri 10) - Execution engine ready
4. **Autonomous Engine** (pri 20) - Intelligence loops start
5. **Queen Redistribution** (pri 25) - Begins analyzing opportunities
6. **Command Center** (pri 50) - Internal dashboard ready

Within ~30 seconds, all systems are operational and Power Station shows "RUNNING".

## 🎯 Key Differences from Command Center

| Feature | Power Station (8080) | Command Center (8800) |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Energy flows & optimization | System internals & diagnostics |
| **Metrics** | Energy reserves, generation, conservation | Bot counts, scanner status, API health |
| **User Type** | End users, traders | Developers, system admins |
| **Update Rate** | 5 seconds | 3 seconds |
| **View** | Energy-centric (all in energy terms) | Technical (raw system metrics) |
| **Priority** | 1 (starts first) | 50 (starts last) |

---

## 📈 Energy Growth Tracking

The Power Station calculates **Energy Growth** by:

1. **Baseline Capture** (on startup):
   ```python
   baseline = get_total_system_energy()
   # Stored in self.total_energy_at_start
   ```

2. **Current Energy** (every cycle):
   ```python
   current = get_total_system_energy()
   ```

3. **Growth Calculation**:
   ```python
   energy_growth = current - baseline
   growth_percentage = (energy_growth / baseline) * 100
   ```

4. **Display**:
   - Green ⚡📈 if growing
   - Red ⚠️📉 if declining
   - Yellow ⚡━ if stable

This shows the system's **net energy generation over time** - the ultimate measure of success.
