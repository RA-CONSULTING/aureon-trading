# Aureon System Integration Map

Current tracked snapshot: 2026-07-12.

This map is the bridge between the repo-wide sitemap and a SaaS integration
view. It answers the practical question: which systems exist, what capabilities
they support, which entry points matter, which public artifacts the frontend can
read, and which safety gate applies before a system is exposed to end users.

Machine-readable map: [`system_integration_map.json`](system_integration_map.json),
mirrored to
[`../frontend/public/aureon_system_integration_map.json`](../frontend/public/aureon_system_integration_map.json).

Generate and validate from repo root:

```text
python scripts/validation/generate_repo_navigation_index.py
python scripts/validation/generate_system_integration_map.py
python scripts/validation/validate_repo_navigation_contract.py
```

## How To Use It

1. Start with [`REPO_SITEMAP.md`](REPO_SITEMAP.md) for the top-level structure.
2. Use [`END_USER_ACCESS_MAP.md`](END_USER_ACCESS_MAP.md) for task-based routes.
3. Use `system_integration_map.json` to bind each repo system to capabilities,
   entrypoints, public artifacts, validation references, and safety gates.
4. Use [`SAAS_INTEGRATION_READINESS.md`](SAAS_INTEGRATION_READINESS.md) for env,
   deployment, and auth boundaries.
5. Use [`SUPABASE_HARDENING_REVIEW.md`](SUPABASE_HARDENING_REVIEW.md) before
   exposing hosted Supabase functions.

## Public Contract

The generated system integration map contains paths, labels, counts,
capability IDs, safety gates, and readiness statuses only. It does not contain
source contents, credentials, environment values, private runtime state,
customer data, or local evidence exports.

## Readiness Terms

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `mapped_for_end_user_navigation` | Public or local navigation surface is mapped and safe to expose as metadata. |
| `integration_ready_with_production_gates` | The system is a SaaS/deploy surface, but production gates still apply. |
| `operator_controlled_before_saas_exposure` | The system is useful, but live or sensitive workflows must stay under operator control. |
| `preserved_for_audit_not_current_product_surface` | The system is retained for provenance and should not be treated as current product copy. |
| `mapped_with_review_gate` | The system is mapped, but requires review before hosted or mutable use. |

## Validation Contract

The validator checks that the docs and frontend public mirrors are identical,
that the map covers every top-level system in `docs/repo_sitemap.json`, that
the tracked count matches `git ls-files`, and that the public mirror is
secret-free.
