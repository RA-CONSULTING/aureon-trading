# 🏭 Aureon — Production-Grade Program

How the Aureon software is held to production standard, and the honest, tracked
plan for getting the rest of the tree there.

> **The core decision.** The repo is ~2,500 Python files, much of it intentional
> research/mythopoeic code. A legacy tree that size cannot be certified
> production-correct in one pass, and it would be dishonest to claim otherwise.
> So production grade is a **two-tier program**: a **strict tier** held clean and
> gated in CI, and a **foundation tier** (packaging, serving, containers, CI,
> lint/type *baseline*) that makes the whole repo production-*capable* while the
> rest is hardened on a tracked ledger.

## Two tiers

### Strict tier — the product surface `aureon/operator/`
The switchboard + cognition service. Held to:
- **ruff — 0 errors** (`ruff check aureon/operator/`)
- **mypy — 0 errors** (`mypy aureon/operator/`, `check_untyped_defs` + `no_implicit_optional`)
- **tests green** (`tests/test_operator_*.py`, offline)

CI **blocks** on all three (`.github/workflows/operator-ci.yml`).

### Foundation tier — whole repo
- **Packaging** — `pyproject.toml`: installable `aureon` (`pip install -e '.[operator,dev]'`),
  `operator`/`dev` extras, `aureon-operator` entrypoint, one home for tool config.
  Bare-import shims (`conftest.py`, `aureon/_path_setup.py`) kept, so nothing breaks.
- **Python unified on 3.12** (runtime.txt · Dockerfiles · CI).
- **Lint/type baseline (ratchet)** — ruff configured repo-wide; the informational
  CI job `ruff check aureon/ --statistics` records the baseline so it can only
  shrink. `mypy` is gradual (`follow_imports=skip`, `ignore_missing_imports`)
  everywhere except the strict tier.
- **Pre-commit** — ruff (fix) + format on changed files only.

## Production serving surface

| Concern | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| WSGI server | `aureon/operator/wsgi.py` → waitress | `main()` serves under waitress; Flask dev server only if `AUREON_OPERATOR_DEV=1` |
| Liveness | `GET /healthz` | up + line-up |
| Readiness | `GET /readyz` | providers + repo index; 503 until usable |
| Metrics | `GET /metrics` | Prometheus exposition of `aureon_operator_*` |
| Config validation | `OperatorConfig.validate()` | fail-fast at boot on bad values |
| Auth | `AUREON_OPERATOR_API_KEY` | bearer on `/api/*`; **off by default**; probes open |
| Rate limit | `AUREON_OPERATOR_RATE_RPS` | token bucket → 429 + Retry-After; off by default |
| Body cap / errors | `AUREON_OPERATOR_MAX_BODY` | uniform JSON `{error:{code,message}}` |

Guardrails from earlier phases still hold: hard authority boundaries
(live-trade / payment / gate-bypass / credential / filing) are refused
deterministically; `AUREON_LLM_OFFLINE` / `AUREON_AUDIT_MODE` disable all network;
`AUREON_SOVEREIGN_MODE` stays off.

## Build · CI · deploy

- **Container** — `deploy/operator.Dockerfile` (multi-stage, non-root, 3.12,
  waitress, `HEALTHCHECK /healthz`); `deploy/docker-compose.operator.yml`.
- **CI** — `operator-ci.yml` (strict gate + informational ratchet, 3.12);
  `main_ci.yml` bumped to 3.12.
- **Deploy runbook** — [`../deployment/OPERATOR_DEPLOY.md`](../deployment/OPERATOR_DEPLOY.md).

```bash
pip install -e '.[operator,dev]'
ruff check aureon/operator/ && mypy aureon/operator/
AUREON_LLM_OFFLINE=1 pytest tests/test_operator_*.py -q
docker build -t aureon-operator -f deploy/operator.Dockerfile .
```

## The ledger — getting the rest of the tree there

Honest, tracked follow-on (not done in the foundation pass). Each item is a
discrete, reviewable unit of work:

| # | Item | Baseline (measured) | Done? |
|---|------|--------------------|-------|
| L1 | Repo-wide **safe** ruff autofix (unused imports, ordering, comprehensions) | ~4,300 auto-fixable | ☐ (separate big diff; import-smoke verified) |
| L2 | Triage `F821` undefined-name (potential real bugs) | 164 | ☐ |
| L3 | Split-statement / style ratchet (`E701`/`E702`) | ~1,150 | ☐ |
| L4 | Expand the **strict tier** domain-by-domain (next: `aureon/core`, then `aureon/queen`) | — | ☐ |
| L5 | Per-domain test coverage as each domain enters the strict tier | — | ☐ |

**Ratchet rule:** the repo-wide ruff count is informational today; once L1–L3 land,
flip the ratchet job to *fail on regression above the recorded baseline* so the
number can only go down. Promote a domain into the strict tier only when it is
ruff-clean, mypy-clean under the strict override, and covered by tests.

***🏭 The product surface is gated clean today; the rest of the organism is on a ratchet that only tightens.***
