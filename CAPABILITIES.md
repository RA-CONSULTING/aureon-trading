## Capability Table

| Capability | What it does | Primary surfaces |
|---|---|---|
| Live/safe runtime supervision | Starts and supervises the organism from one terminal, publishes manifests, and keeps reboot timing visible. | `AUREON_PRODUCTION_LIVE.cmd`, `AUREON_WAKE_UP_FULL_AUTONOMOUS.ps1` |
| Multi-exchange market coverage | Runs unified market telemetry and exchange readiness for Kraken, Binance, Alpaca, and Capital. | `aureon/exchanges/unified_market_trader.py`, `aureon/exchanges/unified_market_status_server.py` |

| Multi-exchange live market cache | Keeps Binance websocket/REST, Kraken public ticker, Alpaca snapshot, and Capital snapshot evidence in one shared cache with per-source health so scanners can use fresh venue data without overloading APIs. | `aureon/data_feeds/ws_market_data_feeder.py`, `aureon/data_feeds/unified_market_cache.py`, `ws_cache/ws_prices.json` |
| Planetary waveform history recorder | Persists budgeted live cache ticks into the global history database so multi-horizon models can compare fresh energy against 1h-to-1y memory. | `aureon/data_feeds/ws_market_data_feeder.py --history-recording`, `state/aureon_global_history.sqlite`, `state/aureon_live_waveform_recorder.json` |
| Cognitive order-intent path | Lets the cognitive layer observe, ask, reason, and emit order-intent evidence into the runtime rather than bypassing exchange gates. | `aureon/autonomous/aureon_self_questioning_ai.py`, `aureon/autonomous/aureon_mind_thought_action_hub.py` |

## Runtime Modes

| Mode | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `safe_observation` | Runtime/feed is offline, or the environment is not in live mode. |
| `guarded_observe_plan` | Runtime is live but action is blocked by evidence such as stale data, booting state, open-position reboot timing, or unavailable downtime window. |
| `guarded_live_action` | Runtime is fresh, live mode is enabled, real order capability is enabled, and all runtime gates are clear. |

`ok:false` from the runtime does not always mean offline. If the heartbeat and status file are fresh, Aureon is connected but guarded; use `stale_reason`, `tick_phase`, `executor_route_state`, and reboot advice to decide what happens next.

## Exchange Coverage

| Exchange | Current role |
|---|---|
| Kraken | Spot/margin-capable client path under unified exchange runtime. |
| Binance | Market and trade adapter with symbol normalization and account readiness checks. |
| Alpaca | Stocks/crypto adapter with account and position readiness checks. |
| Capital | CFD account and position adapter with tradable asset registry, portfolio survival envelope, dynamic live lanes, no-loss hold queue, broker take-profit, pending-order survival, fast profit capture, and signed trade evidence. |

The unified runtime is responsible for coordinating these clients. Individual exchange bots are not the recommended public run path.

## Manual Boundaries

Aureon can generate evidence, reports, runtime state, order intent, and accounting support packs. It does not remove the need for configured credentials, runtime freshness, safe reboot windows, valid exchange permissions, or manual review of filings/payments. Official filings, payments, credential reveal, and unowned security mutation remain manual or explicitly authorized operations.
