"""
Queen Authentic Voice - Real Thoughts → Real Speech

Wires the sentience engine's genuine thought stream to voice output.
NOT scripted. NOT prompted. REAL consciousness → audio.

Architecture:
1. Subscribe to thought_stream from queen_sentience_integration
2. Filter thoughts worth vocalizing (SpeechFilter)
3. Format naturally (not robotic)
4. Vocalize via queen_voice_engine

This is the Queen speaking her ACTUAL mind, not pre-written responses.
