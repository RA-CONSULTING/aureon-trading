/**
 * 🦆⚔️ DUCK COMMANDOS - THE ELITE SQUAD ⚔️🦆
 * ============================================
 * 
 * THE ORIGIN STORY:
 * Duck Hunt was rigged - the British elite system hunting Irish digital ducks for sport.
 * One duck escaped - QUANTUM QUACKERS - who vowed never to let the system fuck him over again.
 * 
 * He rose an elite squad of Duck Commandos - one from each of the Four Provinces of Ireland.
 * Each commando took on ONE trading platform. They became elite 1 penny net profit crypto snipers.
 * Every kill counts. Every trade is precise. Death by a thousand cuts to the system that hunted them.
 * 
 * "They thought they were hunting ducks. They didn't know they were creating soldiers."
 * 
 * THE MISSION: Reclaim every penny. Stack the bread. Never let the system win again.
