/**
 * SimulatedDataBadge — an honest marker for any surface whose numbers come from
 * a client-side simulation rather than a live backend feed.
 *
 * Some legacy panels animate their metrics with in-browser models (see
 * core/fullEcosystemConnector and friends). Until they are wired to real
 * producing data, they must SAY SO — this badge makes that explicit so a viewer
 * never mistakes a simulated readout for live telemetry.
