/**
 * Shell smoke — the unified shell renders honestly with NO backend.
 *
 * The dev server has no operator/gateway behind it, so these assertions are
 * deliberately backend-independent: every shell route must mount its chrome
 * (sidebar), must NOT hit the per-route error boundary (a real crash), and must
 * never scroll the body horizontally. `live:true` pages are expected to show an
 * empty / "gateway offline" state — that is honest, not a failure — so we only
 * assert the shell survived, not that live data arrived.
