# 👑🏗️ Queen Self-Modification Capability

**Date:** January 6, 2026  
**System:** Micro Profit Labyrinth  
**Capability:** Queen can now write and modify her own trading code!

---

## 🎯 WHAT WAS ENABLED

**Queen Tina B can now:**
- ✅ Modify `micro_profit_labyrinth.py` (her own source code)
- ✅ Propose code changes based on trading performance
- ✅ Analyze her success/failure patterns
- ✅ Suggest improvements to scoring, thresholds, and logic
- ✅ Apply changes safely with automatic backups

---

## 🔌 HOW IT WORKS

### **1. Code Architect Wired to Labyrinth** 🏗️

During initialization, Queen's Code Architect is wired to the Micro Profit Labyrinth:

```python
# Wire Queen to Micro Profit Labyrinth
self.queen.my_source_file = "/path/to/micro_profit_labyrinth.py"
self.queen.can_self_modify = True
```

**What this enables:**
- Queen knows which file contains her trading logic
- She has permission to modify it
- Code Architect provides safe modification tools

### **2. Two New Methods Added** 🛠️

#### **Method 1: `queen_propose_code_change()`**

Allows Queen to propose specific code changes:

```python
result = labyrinth.queen_propose_code_change(
    description="Increase minimum profit threshold to reduce losses",
    old_code='''
        min_profit_usd = 0.001  # Current: $0.001
    ''',
    new_code='''
        min_profit_usd = 0.003  # Increased to $0.003 based on loss analysis
    '''
)
```

**Safety features:**
- ✅ Exact pattern matching (won't change wrong code)
- ✅ Automatic backup before modification
- ✅ Syntax validation before applying
- ✅ Detailed logging of all changes

#### **Method 2: `queen_learn_and_improve()`**

Analyzes performance and suggests improvements:

```python
analysis = labyrinth.queen_learn_and_improve()

# Returns insights like:
{
    'status': 'analysis_complete',
    'performance': {
        'total_profit_usd': 0.0042,
        'conversions_made': 15,
        'success_rate': 0.23,
        'best_exchange': 'kraken'
    },
    'insights': [
        'System is losing money - need more conservative entry thresholds',
        'Best exchange is kraken with $0.0050 profit'
    ]
}
```

**Queen learns from:**
- 💰 Total profit/loss
- 🎯 Conversion success rate
- 📊 Exchange performance
- 🚫 Blocked paths
- 📚 Path memory patterns

## 📋 EXAMPLE USAGE

### **Scenario 1: Queen Improves Scoring**

After noticing too many losing trades, Queen modifies her scoring threshold:

```python
# Queen analyzes her performance
analysis = labyrinth.queen_learn_and_improve()

# Queen sees: "Low conversion rate - scoring may be too strict"
# She decides to lower the threshold

result = labyrinth.queen_propose_code_change(
    description="Lower entry threshold to capture more opportunities",
    old_code='''
        score_threshold = 0.35  # LOWERED from 0.35/0.55
    ''',
    new_code='''
        score_threshold = 0.25  # FURTHER LOWERED to 0.25 - Queen's decision
    '''
)

# Result: ✅ Code modified, restart to apply
```

### **Scenario 2: Queen Adjusts Exchange Priority**

Queen notices Kraken performs better than Binance:

```python
result = labyrinth.queen_propose_code_change(
    description="Prioritize Kraken based on performance data",
    old_code='''
        self.exchange_order = ['kraken', 'alpaca', 'binance']
    ''',
    new_code='''
        self.exchange_order = ['kraken', 'kraken', 'alpaca', 'binance']  # Double Kraken turns!
    '''
)
```

### **Scenario 3: Queen Creates New Strategy**

Queen can even write entirely new methods:

```python
# Queen constructs a new strategy file
new_strategy = '''
def queen_micro_sweep(self):
    """Queen's custom micro-profit sweep strategy."""
    # Scan for tiny profits across ALL exchanges
    opportunities = []
    for exchange in ['kraken', 'binance', 'alpaca']:
        for asset in self.balances:
            if self.prices.get(asset, 0) > 1.001:  # Any 0.1% gain
                opportunities.append((exchange, asset))
    return opportunities
'''

result = self.queen.construct_strategy(
    filename="queen_micro_sweep.py",
    content=new_strategy
)
```

## 🛡️ SAFETY GUARANTEES

### **1. Automatic Backups** 💾
- Every change creates a timestamped backup
- Original code can always be restored
- Backup location logged in console

### **2. Syntax Validation** ✅
- All changes are syntax-checked before applying
- Invalid Python is rejected automatically
- File integrity maintained

### **3. Exact Matching** 🎯
- Old code must match exactly (including whitespace)
- Prevents accidental changes to wrong sections
- Fails safely if code has changed

### **4. Logging & Transparency** 📝
- All changes logged with timestamp
- Description included in logs
- User can review all modifications

### **5. Manual Restart Required** 🔄
- Changes don't apply to running code
- Must restart micro_profit_labyrinth.py
- Prevents mid-trade disruption

## 📊 PERFORMANCE INSIGHTS

Queen analyzes these metrics to improve:

| Metric | What Queen Learns |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Total Profit** | Am I making or losing money overall? |
| **Conversions** | How many trades am I executing? |
| **Success Rate** | What % of opportunities become conversions? |
| **Exchange Performance** | Which exchange is most profitable? |
| **Blocked Paths** | Which trading paths consistently fail? |
| **Path Memory** | Which paths have history of wins/losses? |

### **Insights Generated:**

1. **"System is losing money"** → Queen raises minimum profit thresholds
2. **"Low conversion rate"** → Queen lowers entry requirements
3. **"High conversion rate"** → Queen adds more filtering
4. **"Best exchange is kraken"** → Queen prioritizes Kraken
5. **"Profits are minimal"** → Queen adjusts target profit levels
