Risks can come from various sources (i.e, threats) including uncertainty in international markets, political instability, dangers of project failures (at any phase in design, development, production, or sustaining of life-cycles), legal liabilities, credit risk, accidents, natural causes and disasters, deliberate attack from an adversary, or events of uncertain or unpredictable root-cause. Retail traders also apply risk management by using fixed percentage position sizing and risk-to-reward frameworks to avoid large drawdowns and support consistent decision-making under pressure.\nTwo types of events are analyzed in risk management: risks and opportunities. Negative events can be classified as risks while positive events are classified as opportunities.",

Based on works extending over fifty years from the late 1960s onward, he is considered a foundational figure in the areas of single- and multi-channel video and new-media art. Although his work has connections to conceptual art and minimalism, Hill is known for an independent approach that is inspired more by philosophical and literary texts than by central concerns of art and film such as representation, narrative and description. He has used an array of nascent technologies\u2014computer software, projection, virtual reality, CGI\u2014to examine consciousness and its relationship to the body, perception, time, and visual and verbal language. Los Angeles Times critic David Pagel commented, \"Hill creatively uses high-tech instruments to elicit personal experiences of archetypal simplicity. With his work, the invisible operations of thinking take tangible shape. Perception and cognition circle around one another, engaging their subjects.\"\nHill's work belongs to the public collections of the Centre Pompidou, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, Tate Gallery, and Whitney Museum, among others.",

The Irish Bronze Age proper begins around 2000 BC and ends with the arrival of the Iron Age of the Celtic Hallstatt culture, beginning about 600 BC. The subsequent La T\u00e8ne culture brought new styles and practices by 300 BC.\nGreek and Roman \nwriters give some information about Ireland during the Classical period (see \"protohistoric\" period), by which time the island may be termed \"Gaelic Ireland\". By the late 4th century CE Christianity had begun to gradually subsume or replace the earlier Celtic polytheism. By the end of the 6th century, it had introduced writing along with a predominantly monastic Celtic Christian church, profoundly altering Irish society.  Seafaring raiders and pirates from Scandinavia (later referred to as Vikings), settled from the late 8th century AD which resulted in extensive cultural interchange, as well as innovation in military and transport technology. Many of Ireland's towns were founded at this time as Scandinavian trading posts and coinage made its first appearance. Scandinavian penetration was limited and concentrated along coasts and rivers, and ceased to be a major threat to Gaelic culture after the Battle of Clontarf in 1014.",

Irish nationalists during the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries such as the United Irishmen in the 1790s, Young Irelanders in the 1840s, the Fenian Brotherhood during the 1880s, Fianna F\u00e1il in the 1920s, and Sinn F\u00e9in styled themselves in various ways after French left-wing radicalism and republicanism. Irish nationalism celebrates the culture of Ireland, especially the Irish language, literature, music, and sports. It grew more potent during the period in which all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, which led to most of the island gaining independence from the UK in 1922.\nIrish nationalists believe that foreign English and later British rule in Ireland from the 1169 English Norman Invasion of Ireland onwards has been detrimental to Irish interests. At the time of the partition of Ireland most of the island was Roman Catholic and largely indigenous, while a sizeable portion of the country, particularly in the north, was Protestant and chiefly descended from people of Great Britain who colonised the land as settlers during the reign of King James I in 1609.",

For this reason, Brown (2003) notes a preference for the term Insular Christianity. As Patrick Wormald explained, \"One of the common misconceptions is that there was a Roman Church to which the Celtic Church was nationally opposed.\" \nSome writers have described a distinct \"Celtic Church\" uniting the Celtic peoples and distinguishing them from adherents of the Roman Church, while others classify Celtic Christianity as a set of distinctive practices occurring in those areas. Varying scholars reject the former notion, but note that there were certain traditions and practices present in both the Irish and British churches that were not seen in the wider Christian world.\nSuch practices include: a distinctive system for determining the dating of Easter, a style of monastic tonsure, a unique system of penance, and the popularity of going into \"exile for Christ\". Additionally, there were other practices that developed in certain parts of Great Britain and Ireland that were not known to have spread beyond particular regions.",

However, a type of cryptocurrency called a stablecoin may rely upon government action or legislation to require that a stable value be upheld and maintained.\n\nIndividual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger or blockchain, which is a computerized database that uses a consensus mechanism to secure transaction records, control the creation of additional coins, and verify the transfer of coin ownership. The two most common consensus mechanisms are proof of work and proof of stake. Despite the name, which has come to describe many of the fungible blockchain tokens that have been created, cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense, and varying legal treatments have been applied to them in various jurisdictions, including classification as commodities, securities, and currencies. Cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice.\nThe first cryptocurrency was bitcoin, which was first released as open-source software in 2009.",

For example, an arbitrage opportunity is present when there is the possibility to instantaneously buy something for a low price and sell it for a higher price.\nIn principle and in academic use, an arbitrage is risk-free; in common use, as in statistical arbitrage, it may refer to expected profit, though losses may occur, and in practice, there are always risks in arbitrage, some minor (such as fluctuation of prices decreasing profit margins), some major (such as devaluation of a currency or derivative). In academic use, an arbitrage involves taking advantage of differences in price of a single asset or identical cash-flows; in common use, it is also used to refer to differences between similar assets (relative value or convergence trades), as in merger arbitrage.\nThe term is mainly applied in the financial field.",
