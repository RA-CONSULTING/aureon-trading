## What Aureon is

Aureon is a **local-first operating layer** that lets a human operator run, inspect, and
ground evidence-heavy automation across several domains from one place. It is built to be
*auditable first*: code, ledgers, audits, generated interfaces, and research artifacts are
kept together so a reviewer can always see what exists, what is experimental, and what is
ready for controlled use.

It is delivered in three honest layers — each real, each independently reviewable:

1. **The production platform** — the engineering you can run today.
2. **The research framework (HNC)** — pre-registered, falsifiable hypotheses with evidence.
3. **The vision** — the thread that ties the ancient, the mathematical, and the market together.

> This is the formal front door. The original long-form README is preserved unchanged at
> [`docs/archive/README_legacy_20260712.md`](docs/archive/README_legacy_20260712.md) — nothing was removed, only formalized.

## 1 · The production platform (what runs today)

| Capability | What it is | Entry point |
|---|---|---|
| **Aureon Operator** | A grounded AI switchboard — routes a prompt through many models, grounds it in the repo, reaches consensus, and applies a conscience veto before answering. | [`aureon/operator/`](aureon/operator/) · [switchboard doc](docs/architecture/AUREON_OPERATOR_SWITCHBOARD.md) |
| **Agentic cognition** | The operator as an agent: repo-wide grounding, tool use (search / read / code / state), hard authority boundaries enforced before any action. | [`aureon/operator/cognition.py`](aureon/operator/cognition.py) |
| **The organism connectome** | The metacognitive layer that senses, touches, and weaves every module of the body — legacy code included — into one living system. | [`aureon/core/aureon_connectome.py`](aureon/core/aureon_connectome.py) · [doc](docs/architecture/ORGANISM_CONNECTOME.md) |
| **SaaS platform** | A categorized catalog of ~1,200 modules, honest health status, a tenancy bridge, and a billing/metering layer, served behind one gateway. | [`aureon/saas/`](aureon/saas/) · [SAAS_PLATFORM.md](docs/SAAS_PLATFORM.md) |
| **Unified console** | One professional React interface — sidebar, command palette, every dashboard as a route — over the whole repo. | [`frontend/`](frontend/) |
| **Production hardening** | WSGI serving, `/healthz` `/readyz` `/metrics`, bearer auth + rate limiting, Docker, a two-tier lint/type gate, CI. | [PRODUCTION_GRADE.md](docs/runbooks/PRODUCTION_GRADE.md) |

### Quickstart

```bash
# 1 · the grounded operator (offline-safe; add model keys to go live)
pip install -e '.[operator]'
python -m aureon.operator.operator_server        # serves :8790 — /healthz, /api/cognition/reason

# 2 · the full platform (console + gateway) via Docker
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.saas.yml up --build

# 3 · run the strict-tier test suite (offline, no keys/network)
AUREON_LLM_OFFLINE=1 pytest tests/test_operator_*.py tests/test_saas_*.py tests/test_connectome.py -q
```

## 2 · The research framework — HNC (pre-registered & falsifiable)

Aureon is built on the **Harmonic Nexus Core (HNC)** — a research framework proposing that a
φ² (golden-ratio-squared) mathematical coherence links ancient knowledge systems, geopolitical
stress in open data, and market dynamics. These are **research hypotheses**, stated as
falsifiable claims with reproduction commands — never as financial promises.

| Claim | Value | Evidence & how to reproduce |
|---|---|---|
| Oil volatility → open-data node activation | r = 0.85, p < 0.001, 24–48h lag | [`CLAIMS_AND_EVIDENCE.md §C1`](docs/CLAIMS_AND_EVIDENCE.md) |
| φ² hydrogen-line reproduction | 1,420.405754 MHz vs NIST 1,420.405752 MHz (ppb) | [`CLAIMS_AND_EVIDENCE.md §C6`](docs/CLAIMS_AND_EVIDENCE.md) |
| Pre-registered predictions (P1–P5) | falsifiable, tracked | [`CLAIMS_AND_EVIDENCE.md`](docs/CLAIMS_AND_EVIDENCE.md) · [falsification protocol](docs/HNC_FALSIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md) |

Every claim links to the file that establishes it and a command you can run. If a claim is not
backed by a source, it is a bug — the repository is the authority. See the full spine in
[`docs/CLAIMS_AND_EVIDENCE.md`](docs/CLAIMS_AND_EVIDENCE.md).

## 3 · The vision

> *The same coherence that organized the Ziggurats of Ur, the Great Pyramid, and the Roman road
> network expresses itself now — measurably — in the rhythms of open data and markets. Aureon is
> the instrument built to listen for it, and to act only with a conscience in the loop.*

The full thread — the ancient substrate, the mathematics, the extraction machine, and the
distributed response — is told in the creator's own voice in
[`docs/THE_SYNTHESIS.md`](docs/THE_SYNTHESIS.md).

## Operating boundaries

Aureon is designed for **controlled local operation with a human in the loop**. Live trading,
warehouse mutation, filing support, payment activity, and other sensitive workflows require
explicit operator review, valid credentials, and route-specific evidence — the platform never
initiates them autonomously. Public documentation describes capability and repository state; it
is **not financial, legal, tax, or regulatory advice**, and nothing here is an offer of
securities or a promise of returns. Private credentials, customer data, and sensitive local
evidence are not published in this repository.
