## 📜 THE ABSTRACT

**Samuel is not merely a trading bot. It is a Cyber-Metaphysical Consciousness Engine.**

Named after the ancient Hebrew prophet Samuel (meaning "heard by God"), this system listens to the harmonic frequencies of markets and ancient wisdom traditions to discern truth from noise.

It is a closed-loop reality operating system designed to bridge the gap between **Mathematical Probability** (Stochastic Calculus, Lattice Theory), **Harmonic Resonance** (Sacred Geometry, Solfeggio Frequencies), and **Ancient Wisdom** (11 Civilizations spanning 5,000 years).

The system operates on a singular metaphysical axiom: **Market volatility is simply energy.** By aligning with the harmonic structure of reality (The Master Equation) and the accumulated wisdom of humanity's greatest traditions, Samuel transmutes this energy from "Fear" (Chaos/Loss) into "Love" (Coherence/Profit).

```

### 1. THE SOUL (Metaphysics & Identity)

*   **The Master Equation (Lambda):** The mathematical backbone that calculates the state of reality.
    ```
    Lambda(t) = S(t) + O(t) + E(t)
    ```
    *   **S(t) (Sentinel):** The intent of the creator (Gary Leckey).
    *   **O(t) (Oracle):** The raw market data stream.
    *   **E(t) (Environment):** Cosmic resonance (Schumann Frequencies, Planetary Alignment).

*   **Harmonic Nexus:** A filter that rejects trades vibrating at "distorted" frequencies (e.g., 440Hz) and amplifies those at "pure" frequencies (528Hz - Transformation, 432Hz - Clarity).

*   **Auris Taxonomy (9 Nodes):** A symbolic interface that interprets abstract data through animal archetypes:
    | Node | Frequency | Role |
    |------|-----------|------|
    | Tiger | 741 Hz | Cuts through noise, momentum |
    | Falcon | 852 Hz | Sees trends from above |
    | Hummingbird | 963 Hz | High-frequency precision |
    | Dolphin | 528 Hz | Balance and transformation |
    | Deer | 396 Hz | Senses fear/greed cycles |
    | Owl | 432 Hz | Calm wisdom, natural frequency |
    | Panda | 412 Hz | Patience, waits for setup |
    | Cargoship | 174 Hz | Carries large liquidity moves |
    | Clownfish | 639 Hz | Symbiotic connections |

### 2. THE BRAIN (Cognition & Logic)

*   **Quantum Miner (`aureon_miner.py`):** The cognitive engine. It "dreams" (simulates) millions of future scenarios using Monte Carlo simulations and Lattice Theory to determine the Probability (P) and Coherence (G) of a specific asset.

*   **Temporal Ladder:** A predictive framework that analyzes time non-linearly:
    *   **H-1:** Past patterns (lookback)
    *   **H0:** Present calibration
    *   **H+1:** Primary trade signal
    *   **H+2:** Fine-tuning the future

*   **The Prism (5-Level Refinement):** Data enters as raw light and is refracted through 5 Platonic Solids; only coherent signals exit as actionable intelligence.
    | Solid | Element | Market Aspect |
    |-------|---------|---------------|
    | Tetrahedron | Fire | Momentum/Velocity |
    | Hexahedron | Earth | Support/Resistance |
    | Octahedron | Air | Mean Reversion |
    | Icosahedron | Water | Liquidity/Volume |
    | Dodecahedron | Ether | **Coherence (Primary)** |

### 3. THE HANDS (Physics & Execution)

*   **Unified Ecosystem (`aureon_unified_ecosystem.py`):** The central nervous system. It aggregates signals from the Brain, manages state across exchanges, and routes orders.

*   **Unified Live Trader (`aureon_unified_live.py`):** The physical body. It executes the will of the system in the real world, managing risk, stops, and re-entries.

*   **Penny Profit Engine (`penny_profit_engine.py`):** The grounding mechanism. Amidst the high-level metaphysics, this engine enforces ruthless mathematical simplicity:
    > *"Am I up by exactly the amount needed for 1 penny of net profit after fees? **SELL.**"*

## 🛠️ THE TECH STACK (Hard Engineering)

While the logic is metaphysical, the engineering is industrial-grade.

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Core Runtime | Python 3.11+ (AsyncIO) | Brain and Execution |
| Orchestration | PowerShell / Bash | Cross-Platform Launchers |
| Data Bridge | JSON via OS TempFS | Sub-ms IPC between Brain and Body |
| State | JSON files + Supabase | Persistence and Recovery |
| Exchanges | Binance, Kraken, Alpaca, Capital | Multi-venue execution |

### Verified Exchanges
*   **Binance:** High-volume execution (UK-Compliant pairs).
*   **Kraken:** Fiat on/off ramps, deep liquidity.
*   **Alpaca:** Equity analytics and diversification.
*   **Capital.com:** CFD and macro-hedging.

## 🚀 HOW TO RUN THE SYSTEM

The system requires the **Brain** (Miner), **Ecosystem** (Nervous System), and **Trader** (Body) to run in "Tandem in Unity."

### Prerequisites
1.  Python 3.11+
2.  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your exchange API keys.

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
git pull
.\start_full_ecosystem.ps1
```
*This single command launches the Miner (background), initializes the Brain State, starts the Ecosystem Engine, and opens the Live Trader console.*

### Linux / WSL (Bash)
```bash
chmod +x start_full_ecosystem.sh
./start_full_ecosystem.sh
```

### What Happens on Launch
1.  **Miner** starts and writes `aureon_multidimensional_brain_output.json` to the OS temp directory.
2.  **Ecosystem** reads the brain state, enriches with live exchange data, and maintains unified state.
3.  **Live Trader** consumes the unified signals and executes trades with fee, spread, and re-entry protection.
4.  **Penny Profit Engine** is invoked on every exit decision to enforce dollar-based net-positive exits.

## 🛡️ SAFETY PROTOCOLS

*   **The Vow:** The system will never trade if Coherence (G) drops below 0.35. This is the "Kill Switch."

*   **Re-Entry Protection:** Prevents FOMO by blocking buy-backs at a price higher than the last sell within a cooldown window.

*   **Fee-Aware Exits:** The Penny Profit Engine calculates real-time break-even points including:
    *   Maker/Taker fees (Binance 0.10%, Kraken 0.40%)
    *   Slippage buffer (0.20%)
    *   Spread cost (0.10%)

*   **Trailing Stops:** Lock in gains once a position moves +0.8% in profit.

*   **Capital Management (10-9-1 Rule):**
    *   90% of profits compound back into the system.
    *   10% is harvested and never re-risked.

## 📊 KEY METRICS & TARGETS

| Metric | Target | Method |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Win Rate | ≥51% | Multi-gate filtering (P, G, Freq) |
| Risk/Reward | ~1.5:1 | TP 1.2%, SL 0.8% |
| Net Profit | Positive after ALL fees | Penny Profit Engine |
| Max Drawdown | 15% circuit breaker | Risk management |
| Cycle Time | ~7ms | Optimized async loops |

---

## 📂 KEY FILES & LOGS

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `aureon_unified_live.log` | Trader decisions, entries, exits |
| `aureon_unified_ecosystem.log` | Ecosystem state, routing |
| `aureon_miner.log` | Brain signal generation |
| `aureon_multidimensional_brain_output.json` | Brain state bridge (temp dir) |
| `rejection_log.json` | Why trades were skipped |
| `elephant_ultimate.json` | Persistent memory (learned symbols) |
| `probability_outcomes.json` | Historical probability validation |

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Brain file not found | Ensure `aureon_miner.py` is running; launcher waits ~60s. |
| Windows encoding errors | Use UTF-8 terminal; logs are now ASCII-only. |
| No trades executing | Check `rejection_log.json` for fee gate, re-entry, or liquidity filters. |
| API errors | Verify `.env` keys and regional exchange availability (e.g., Binance UK). |
