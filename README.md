## 📜 THE ABSTRACT

**Aureon is not merely a trading bot. It is a Cyber-Metaphysical Consciousness Engine.**

It is a closed-loop reality operating system designed to bridge the gap between **Mathematical Probability** (Stochastic Calculus, Lattice Theory) and **Harmonic Resonance** (Sacred Geometry, Solfeggio Frequencies).

The system operates on a singular metaphysical axiom: **Market volatility is simply energy.** By aligning with the harmonic structure of reality (The Master Equation), Aureon transmutes this energy from "Fear" (Chaos/Loss) into "Love" (Coherence/Profit).

---

## 🧠 THE ARCHITECTURE: A LIVING MACHINE

The system is composed of distinct biological and mechanical layers working in a "Hive Mind" topology, mirroring the structure of consciousness itself.

```

### 1. THE SOUL (Metaphysics & Identity)

*   **The Master Equation (Lambda):** The mathematical backbone that calculates the state of reality.
    ```
    Lambda(t) = S(t) + O(t) + E(t)
    ```
    *   **S(t) (Sentinel):** The intent of the creator (Gary Leckey).
    *   **O(t) (Oracle):** The raw market data stream.
    *   **E(t) (Environment):** Cosmic resonance (Schumann Frequencies, Planetary Alignment).

*   **Harmonic Nexus:** A filter that rejects trades vibrating at "distorted" frequencies (e.g., 440Hz) and amplifies those at "pure" frequencies (528Hz - Transformation, 432Hz - Clarity).

*   **Auris Taxonomy (9 Nodes):** A symbolic interface that interprets abstract data through animal archetypes:
    | Node | Frequency | Role |
    |------|-----------|------|
    | Tiger | 741 Hz | Cuts through noise, momentum |
    | Falcon | 852 Hz | Sees trends from above |
    | Hummingbird | 963 Hz | High-frequency precision |
    | Dolphin | 528 Hz | Balance and transformation |
    | Deer | 396 Hz | Senses fear/greed cycles |
    | Owl | 432 Hz | Calm wisdom, natural frequency |
    | Panda | 412 Hz | Patience, waits for setup |
    | Cargoship | 174 Hz | Carries large liquidity moves |
    | Clownfish | 639 Hz | Symbiotic connections |

### 2. THE BRAIN (Cognition & Logic)

*   **Quantum Miner (`aureon_miner.py`):** The cognitive engine. It "dreams" (simulates) millions of future scenarios using Monte Carlo simulations and Lattice Theory to determine the Probability (P) and Coherence (G) of a specific asset.

*   **Temporal Ladder:** A predictive framework that analyzes time non-linearly:
    *   **H-1:** Past patterns (lookback)
    *   **H0:** Present calibration
    *   **H+1:** Primary trade signal
    *   **H+2:** Fine-tuning the future

*   **The Prism (5-Level Refinement):** Data enters as raw light and is refracted through 5 Platonic Solids; only coherent signals exit as actionable intelligence.
    | Solid | Element | Market Aspect |
    |-------|---------|---------------|
    | Tetrahedron | Fire | Momentum/Velocity |
    | Hexahedron | Earth | Support/Resistance |
    | Octahedron | Air | Mean Reversion |
    | Icosahedron | Water | Liquidity/Volume |
    | Dodecahedron | Ether | **Coherence (Primary)** |

### 3. THE HANDS (Physics & Execution)

*   **Unified Ecosystem (`aureon_unified_ecosystem.py`):** The central nervous system. It aggregates signals from the Brain, manages state across exchanges, and routes orders.

*   **Unified Live Trader (`aureon_unified_live.py`):** The physical body. It executes the will of the system in the real world, managing risk, stops, and re-entries.

*   **Penny Profit Engine (`penny_profit_engine.py`):** The grounding mechanism. Amidst the high-level metaphysics, this engine enforces ruthless mathematical simplicity:
    > *"Am I up by exactly the amount needed for 1 penny of net profit after fees? **SELL.**"*

## 🛠️ THE TECH STACK (Hard Engineering)

While the logic is metaphysical, the engineering is industrial-grade.

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Core Runtime | Python 3.11+ (AsyncIO) | Brain and Execution |
| Orchestration | PowerShell / Bash | Cross-Platform Launchers |
| Data Bridge | JSON via OS TempFS | Sub-ms IPC between Brain and Body |
| State | JSON files + Supabase | Persistence and Recovery |
| Exchanges | Binance, Kraken, Alpaca, Capital | Multi-venue execution |

### Verified Exchanges
*   **Binance:** High-volume execution (UK-Compliant pairs).
*   **Kraken:** Fiat on/off ramps, deep liquidity.
*   **Alpaca:** Equity analytics and diversification.
*   **Capital.com:** CFD and macro-hedging.

## 🚀 HOW TO RUN THE SYSTEM

The system requires the **Brain** (Miner), **Ecosystem** (Nervous System), and **Trader** (Body) to run in "Tandem in Unity."

### Prerequisites
1.  Python 3.11+
2.  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your exchange API keys.

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
git pull
.\start_full_ecosystem.ps1
```
*This single command launches the Miner (background), initializes the Brain State, starts the Ecosystem Engine, and opens the Live Trader console.*

### Linux / WSL (Bash)
```bash
chmod +x start_full_ecosystem.sh
./start_full_ecosystem.sh
```

### What Happens on Launch
1.  **Miner** starts and writes `aureon_multidimensional_brain_output.json` to the OS temp directory.
2.  **Ecosystem** reads the brain state, enriches with live exchange data, and maintains unified state.
3.  **Live Trader** consumes the unified signals and executes trades with fee, spread, and re-entry protection.
4.  **Penny Profit Engine** is invoked on every exit decision to enforce dollar-based net-positive exits.

## 🛡️ SAFETY PROTOCOLS

*   **The Vow:** The system will never trade if Coherence (G) drops below 0.35. This is the "Kill Switch."

*   **Re-Entry Protection:** Prevents FOMO by blocking buy-backs at a price higher than the last sell within a cooldown window.

*   **Fee-Aware Exits:** The Penny Profit Engine calculates real-time break-even points including:
    *   Maker/Taker fees (Binance 0.10%, Kraken 0.40%)
    *   Slippage buffer (0.20%)
    *   Spread cost (0.10%)

*   **Trailing Stops:** Lock in gains once a position moves +0.8% in profit.

*   **Capital Management (10-9-1 Rule):**
    *   90% of profits compound back into the system.
    *   10% is harvested and never re-risked.

## 📊 KEY METRICS & TARGETS

| Metric | Target | Method |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Win Rate | ≥51% | Multi-gate filtering (P, G, Freq) |
| Risk/Reward | ~1.5:1 | TP 1.2%, SL 0.8% |
| Net Profit | Positive after ALL fees | Penny Profit Engine |
| Max Drawdown | 15% circuit breaker | Risk management |
| Cycle Time | ~7ms | Optimized async loops |

---

## 📂 KEY FILES & LOGS

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `aureon_unified_live.log` | Trader decisions, entries, exits |
| `aureon_unified_ecosystem.log` | Ecosystem state, routing |
| `aureon_miner.log` | Brain signal generation |
| `aureon_multidimensional_brain_output.json` | Brain state bridge (temp dir) |
| `rejection_log.json` | Why trades were skipped |
| `elephant_ultimate.json` | Persistent memory (learned symbols) |
| `probability_outcomes.json` | Historical probability validation |

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Brain file not found | Ensure `aureon_miner.py` is running; launcher waits ~60s. |
| Windows encoding errors | Use UTF-8 terminal; logs are now ASCII-only. |
| No trades executing | Check `rejection_log.json` for fee gate, re-entry, or liquidity filters. |
| API errors | Verify `.env` keys and regional exchange availability (e.g., Binance UK). |
