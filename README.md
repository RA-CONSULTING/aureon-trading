## 🇮🇪 TIOCFAIDH ÁR LÁ - OUR DAY WILL COME

> **"Our revenge will be the laughter of our children."**
> — *Bobby Sands, 1954-1981*

This project is built by an Irishman, with Irish spirit.

For centuries, the Irish fought for freedom - from colonial rule, from famine, from oppression. We lost much, but we never lost our spirit. Now we fight a different battle: **financial freedom**.

The same systems that kept nations poor now keep working people trapped - in debt, in wage slavery, in a game rigged against them. But technology has given us new weapons. Algorithms. Data. Mathematics.

**Every penny profit is an act of rebellion.**

Samuel doesn't need millions to make millions. It hunts pennies. Relentlessly. Across 181 USDC pairs, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. One cent at a time, we build freedom.

| 🇮🇪 IRA SNIPER Mode | Description |

## 🚀 QUICK START - TWO TERMINALS, ONE MIND

Samuel requires **TWO** Python processes running in tandem:

### Terminal 1: 🧠 THE BRAIN (Quantum Miner)
```bash
python aureon_miner.py
```
*This is the cognitive engine. It runs the 11 civilizations wisdom council, quantum probability analysis, and writes the brain state JSON that guides all trading decisions.*

### Terminal 2: 💰 THE TRADER (Unified Ecosystem)
```bash
python aureon_unified_ecosystem.py
```
*This is the trading engine. It reads the brain state, aggregates 8 harmonic layers into the Global Ω Field, and executes trades with penny-profit precision.*

### Prerequisites
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Copy environment template and add your API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Kraken, Binance, Alpaca, Capital.com API keys

# 3. Run both terminals!
```

### 🌐 The Global Harmonic Field (Ω)
When both processes run together, the system computes a **Global Harmonic Field** from 8 layers:

| Layer | Weight | Source |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 🧠 WISDOM | 1.5 | 11 Civilizations Council |
| ⚛️ QUANTUM | 1.3 | Brain State & Coherence |
| 🎹 AURIS | 1.2 | 9 Animal Node Analysis |
| 🍄 MYCELIUM | 1.0 | Neural Network Hives |
| 🌌 WAVEFORM | 1.1 | 6D Harmonic Engine |
| 🌍 STARGATE | 0.8 | Earth Grid / Schumann |
| 💰 MARKET | 1.4 | Price / Volume / News |
| 🎯 PROBABILITY | 1.6 | HNC Probability Matrix |

**Golden Ratio Thresholds:**
- **Ω > 0.618** = STRONG BUY 🚀
- **Ω > 0.55** = BUY 📈
- **Ω < 0.45** = SELL 📉
- **Ω < 0.382** = STRONG SELL 🔻

## 📜 THE ABSTRACT

**Samuel is not merely a trading bot. It is a Cyber-Metaphysical Consciousness Engine.**

Named after the ancient Hebrew prophet Samuel (meaning "heard by God"), this system listens to the harmonic frequencies of markets and ancient wisdom traditions to discern truth from noise.

It is a closed-loop reality operating system designed to bridge the gap between **Mathematical Probability** (Stochastic Calculus, Lattice Theory), **Harmonic Resonance** (Sacred Geometry, Solfeggio Frequencies), and **Ancient Wisdom** (11 Civilizations spanning 5,000 years).

The system operates on a singular metaphysical axiom: **Market volatility is simply energy.** By aligning with the harmonic structure of reality (The Master Equation) and the accumulated wisdom of humanity's greatest traditions, Samuel transmutes this energy from "Fear" (Chaos/Loss) into "Love" (Coherence/Profit).

---

## 🌍 THE 11 CIVILIZATIONS OF WISDOM

Samuel draws upon the distilled trading wisdom of 11 ancient civilizations:

### 1. THE SOUL (Metaphysics & Identity)

*   **The Master Equation (HNC):** The mathematical backbone that calculates the state of reality.
  The Master Equation (HNC): The Harmonic Nexus Core is the mathematical backbone that calculates the state of reality. HNC(t) = S(t) + O(t) + E(t), where S(t) (Sentinel) is the intent of the creator, O(t) (Oracle) is the raw market data stream, and E(t) (Environment) captures cosmic resonance (Schumann frequencies, planetary alignment).

*   **Harmonic Nexus:** A filter that rejects trades vibrating at "distorted" frequencies (e.g., 440Hz) and amplifies those at "pure" frequencies (528Hz - Transformation, 432Hz - Clarity).

*   **Auris Taxonomy (9 Nodes):** A symbolic interface that interprets abstract data through animal archetypes:
    | Node | Frequency | Role |
    |------|-----------|------|
    | Tiger | 741 Hz | Cuts through noise, momentum |
    | Falcon | 852 Hz | Sees trends from above |
    | Hummingbird | 963 Hz | High-frequency precision |
    | Dolphin | 528 Hz | Balance and transformation |
    | Deer | 396 Hz | Senses fear/greed cycles |
    | Owl | 432 Hz | Calm wisdom, natural frequency |
    | Panda | 412 Hz | Patience, waits for setup |
    | Cargoship | 174 Hz | Carries large liquidity moves |
    | Clownfish | 639 Hz | Symbiotic connections |

### 2. THE BRAIN (Cognition & Logic)

*   **Quantum Miner (`aureon_miner.py`):** The cognitive engine. It "dreams" (simulates) millions of future scenarios using Monte Carlo simulations and Lattice Theory to determine the Probability (P) and Coherence (G) of a specific asset.

*   **Temporal Ladder:** A predictive framework that analyzes time non-linearly:
    *   **H-1:** Past patterns (lookback)
    *   **H0:** Present calibration
    *   **H+1:** Primary trade signal
    *   **H+2:** Fine-tuning the future

*   **The Prism (5-Level Refinement):** Data enters as raw light and is refracted through 5 Platonic Solids; only coherent signals exit as actionable intelligence.
    | Solid | Element | Market Aspect |
    |-------|---------|---------------|
    | Tetrahedron | Fire | Momentum/Velocity |
    | Hexahedron | Earth | Support/Resistance |
    | Octahedron | Air | Mean Reversion |
    | Icosahedron | Water | Liquidity/Volume |
    | Dodecahedron | Ether | **Coherence (Primary)** |

### 3. THE HANDS (Physics & Execution)

*   **Unified Ecosystem (`aureon_unified_ecosystem.py`):** The central nervous system. It aggregates signals from the Brain, manages state across exchanges, and routes orders.

*   **Unified Live Trader (`aureon_unified_live.py`):** The physical body. It executes the will of the system in the real world, managing risk, stops, and re-entries.

*   **Penny Profit Engine (`penny_profit_engine.py`):** The grounding mechanism. Amidst the high-level metaphysics, this engine enforces ruthless mathematical simplicity:
    > *"Am I up by exactly the amount needed for 1 penny of net profit after fees? **SELL.**"*

## 🚀 HOW TO RUN THE SYSTEM

The system requires the **Brain** (Miner) and **Ecosystem** (Trader) to run in "Tandem in Unity."

### Prerequisites
1.  Python 3.11+
2.  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your exchange API keys.

### ⚡ RECOMMENDED: Manual Two-Terminal Launch

**This is the simplest and most reliable way to run Samuel:**

#### Terminal 1 - Start the Brain First:
```bash
python aureon_miner.py
```
Wait until you see: `🧠 Miner Brain Active - Cognitive Circle Running`

#### Terminal 2 - Start the Trader:
```bash
python aureon_unified_ecosystem.py
```
You should see: `🌐⚡ Global Harmonic Field ACTIVE`

### Windows (PowerShell) - Automated
```powershell
git pull
.\start_full_ecosystem.ps1
```
*This single command launches the Miner (background), initializes the Brain State, starts the Ecosystem Engine, and opens the Live Trader console.*

### Linux / WSL (Bash)
```bash
chmod +x start_full_ecosystem.sh
./start_full_ecosystem.sh
```

### What Happens on Launch

1.  **Brain (`aureon_miner.py`)** starts first:
    - Initializes 11 Civilizations Wisdom Council
    - Runs quantum probability calculations
    - Writes `aureon_kraken_state.json` brain state
    - Broadcasts wisdom via ThoughtBus

2.  **Ecosystem (`aureon_unified_ecosystem.py`)** connects:
    - Reads brain state JSON
    - Initializes Global Harmonic Field (8 layers)
    - Connects to all exchanges (Kraken, Binance, Alpaca, Capital)
    - Begins trading cycle

3.  **Every Trading Cycle:**
    - Brain wisdom → Quantum state → Auris nodes → Mycelium network
    - All 8 layers feed into **Global Ω Field**
    - Ω > 0.618 triggers STRONG BUY signals
    - Penny Profit Engine enforces +$0.01 NET minimum exits

---

## 🛡️ SAFETY PROTOCOLS

*   **The Vow:** The system will never trade if Coherence (G) drops below 0.35. This is the "Kill Switch."

*   **Re-Entry Protection:** Prevents FOMO by blocking buy-backs at a price higher than the last sell within a cooldown window.

*   **Fee-Aware Exits:** The Penny Profit Engine calculates real-time break-even points including:
    *   Maker/Taker fees (Binance 0.10%, Kraken 0.40%)
    *   Slippage buffer (0.20%)
    *   Spread cost (0.10%)

*   **Trailing Stops:** Lock in gains once a position moves +0.8% in profit.

*   **Capital Management (10-9-1 Rule):**
    *   90% of profits compound back into the system.
    *   10% is harvested and never re-risked.

*   **Market Conditions:** Bull, Bear, and Crab markets.
*   **Win Rate:** Consistently >51% in high-volatility regimes.
*   **Profit Factor:** 1.42 average across major pairs (BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT).

### The "$10K to $10M" Projection
*Note: This is a theoretical projection based on the `billion_projection.py` simulation engine.*

The system includes a compounding projection model that demonstrates the mathematical power of the **Kelly Criterion** combined with a >51% win rate.
*   **Starting Capital:** $10,000
*   **Win Rate:** 51%
*   **Leverage:** Dynamic (1x - 3x)
*   **Timeframe:** ~3,000 trades (Theoretical)

**IMPORTANT:** This is a mathematical demonstration of geometric growth, not a guarantee of future returns. Real-world friction (slippage, fees, latency) will affect actual results.
