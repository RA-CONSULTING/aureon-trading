# NEXUS Live Feed

NEXUS Live Feed is an upcoming live event feed (LVE) system from Famous IO. The project aims to deliver real-time updates and streaming capabilities for events.

## Storm Targeting

The service now exposes a `/storm` endpoint that queries live NOAA weather alerts and returns the most severe active storm. This demonstrates dynamic storm targeting capabilities.

## Celestial Chart

A new `/celestial-chart` endpoint is now available, generating a real-time star and planet chart. This feature provides a dynamic, beautiful tapestry of our solar system, offering a glimpse into the vastness of space and our place within it.
